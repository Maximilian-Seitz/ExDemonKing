# Company

Auli explained how our pretend familial relationship was the method
they had exploited to allow for my expeditious acceptance into the city.
Joining her in this lie was apparently the man who had taken care of me earlier,
who, among other things, served as a priest and healer in this temple.
I was also assured the secrecy of our companions in the jungle,
in a claim brimming with confidence.
It made me question the means used to achieve this unanimous agreement,
but I had nether the chance, nor the intent to voice these concerns.

The conversation then quickly diverged into an introduction
to the city's amenities and offerings I now had access to.
Auli's almost unfiltered expression of her train of thought
made it a difficult explanation to follow,
but the enthusiasm she displayed throughout,
made it an enjoyable experience on the whole.
Having been alone with my thoughts for the extent of time that I had,
I also appreciated the company she provided,
especially now that I was unable to distract myself with physical activities.

Eventually the food and water,
promised to me by the man I now knew as Sutarbi, was brought,
interrupting Auli's tales of bathhouse antics, which she had moved on to.
The appearances of the two priests I had now met were quite similar,
differing mainly in their hair and strength of aura.
While Sutarbi's head was bald, this man had short black locks,
and their auras were simply incomparable.

The two guests in my room shared a brief exchange of words unfamiliar to me,
throughout which the priest showed a wide smile.
Auli, on the other hand, had had such a smile for most of her visit,
while she had told tales of places to see, and foods she had eaten.
I opted to use their talk as a chance to eat
the baked goods and various fruits I had received.
Afterwards the man left, and I listened to Auli once again,
until I drifted off into sleep, tired from the food,
and still not nearly recovered from my wounds.

By the time I awakened once more, I was alone,
but found a plate of food placed on a chair, next to my bed.
