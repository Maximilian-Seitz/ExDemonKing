# Company

Auli explained how our pretend familial relationship was the method
they had exploited to allow for my expeditious acceptance into the city.
Joining her in this lie was apparently the man who had taken care of me earlier,
who, among other things, served as a priest and healer in this temple.
I was also assured the secrecy of our companions in the jungle,
in a claim brimming with confidence.
It made me question the means used to achieve this unanimous agreement,
but I had nether the chance, nor the intent to voice these concerns.

The conversation then quickly diverged into an introduction
to the city's amenities and offerings I now had access to.
Auli's almost unfiltered expression of her train of thought
made it a difficult explanation to follow,
but the enthusiasm she displayed throughout,
made it an enjoyable experience on the whole.
Having been alone with my thoughts for the extent of time that I had,
I also appreciated the company she provided,
especially now that I was unable to distract myself with physical activities.

Eventually the food and water,
promised to me by the man I now knew as Sutarbi, was brought,
interrupting Auli's tales of bathhouse antics, which she had moved on to.
The appearances of the two priests I had now met were quite similar,
differing mainly in their hair and strength of aura.
While Sutarbi's head was bald, this man had short black locks,
and their auras were simply incomparable.

The two guests in my room shared a brief exchange of words unfamiliar to me,
throughout which the priest showed a wide smile.
Auli, on the other hand, had had such a smile for most of her visit,
while she had told tales of places to see, and foods she had eaten.
I opted to use their talk as a chance to eat
the baked goods and various fruits I had received.
Afterwards the man left, and I listened to Auli once again,
until I drifted off into sleep, tired from the food,
and still not nearly recovered from my wounds.

By the time I awakened once more, I was alone,
but found a plate of food placed on a chair next to my bed.
Both the presence of new food and my sore back
hinted at the extensive length of my sleep,
and so did the lack of presences passing the door.
It must have been night.
I was, once again, left with nothing to do, but now that time was abundant,
I began to consider the implications of what Auli had told me.

A new life awaited me. I had known that it would be in turmoil,
when I had decided to take the path of an adventurer,
but the last few days' events had taken it
into a direction I had never considered.
On the surface, few things differed, but it wasn't a purely semantic change.
I had become a citizen of Hest.
In a way, following Fate's command to find allies,
but more realistically, forcing innocents into danger by association.

I doubted any possibility of the immortal's direct implication.
She, too, was fallible, as proven by her plan to have me become an adventurer,
and her protégé's crushing defeat.
Fate's plan, ironically, had been thwarted by my fate.
My fate to hunt treelins, my fate to be injured, and finally,
my fate to become a citizen.
That was, at least, how I chose to reassure myself
of her lack of involvement in my current situation.
That I hadn't doomed Hest by my presence.

Thoughts such as these captivated me,
sending me tumbling through fictitious scenarios, each worse than the last.
Each leading me nowhere.
In order to break this cycle of horror,
I tried to force my mind on something useful.
I eventually succeeded when I remembered the
surplus of magical power I had acquired.
Instead of worrying about some future to come,
it allowed me to have a hand in it myself, as my weapon of choice.
With complete annihilation of a demon as my final goal,
there was an overwhelming difference of might for me to overcome.
And so I did the only thing I could, besides think, and practiced my magic.

Magical applications within one's own body,
like the soul sight I was making extensive use of,
were inherently limited in their possible effects.
Useful, but ultimately not enough.
I needed to control mana which had escaped the imagined bounds of my flesh,
branching out from its usual path, and acting as an extension of my influence.
To this end, I started to construct a support structure of mana
reminiscent of the one supplying energy to my eyes,
only grew from the tips of my fingers, instead of inwards.

Though the effect was entirely invisible,
I was still able to feel the arcane power leave one finger and enter another.
The surprise from the sudden jolt of energy
broke my concentration on the fragile structure.
Opposed to the spell I was so accustomed to,
this guidance wasn't capable of supporting itself, to stand on its own.
Repeating the experiment resulted in a more stable flow,
until I moved the affected fingers, breaking it.

Knowing what the interaction was supposed to feel like,
I repeated it over and over,
modifying the exact application of magic for each try.
As I came closer to my desired outcome with every attempt
I let myself be absorbed by the practice,
pushing out the thoughts which plagued me as much as I could.
Enthralled by the process, I was ignorant of my surroundings,
leaving me surprised at the approaching guest.

> She's taken a toll on you, hasn't she?

The priest Sutarbi stood next to my bed,
holding the same bag he had brought for his last visit.

> I have made sure she knows the weight of your injuries,
> and will respect the time you will take to heal from now on.

> It wasn't as issue. I rather appreciated her visit, in fact.

> No, it was. You, too, have been reckless, pushing yourself to stay awake.
> Had I known, I would have sent her away much sooner.

> I'm sorry.

> Don't be. It is my domain to educate you on this.
> Doing better from now on is all I can ask of you.

> I'll strife to take my condition into account going forward.

My promise gave rise to a small smile on the man's face.

> My child, your lies are clear to see for even those who have lost their sight,
> and clear to hear for even those who have lost their minds.

The calm, but blunt, reply made my heart sink in an instant.
I hadn't lied, I thought,
but certainly couldn't be said to have spoken the truth either.

> Being her brother, on the other hand,
> seems to be a lie you will tell without causing any doubt.
> You both are driven to go further than you should.
> In fact, you should be sleeping as we speak,
> given the amount of herbs applied to your wounds.

> Well, I should uses the chance to apologize myself.
> When we last spoke, I mentioned your citizenship, but didn't explain.
> I did so knowing it would cause you discomfort,
> selfishly pushing that duty to Auli.
> For that, I am sorry.

I thought of how to respond to this unexpected topic,
but didn't have a chance to, as Sutarbi moved on right away.

> I should also use the chance to increase your dosage of medicine,
> since you have proven your resistance to it.
> Hold out your arm.

With my bandages changed, I felt the same fog return to my thoughts,
which I had felt when I had awakened before.
At my physician's behest, I was able to eat most of the food I had been given,
but fell into a deep slumber shortly after.
The pain which had been with me had become imperceptible,
and it was a slumber with few interruptions.
Fruits were fed to me, while I was half asleep,
and I barely noticed the regular changings of my dressings.
No matter how much I tried to practice the use of my mana whenever I woke up,
I only found myself drift away at every attempt.

Days passed, from most of which I retained no memory,
until my thoughts started to regain the focus they had had before.
When that time came,
my constant companion throughout these struggles was there to welcome me awake.
Explaining that my wounds had mostly healed,
and about my lack of apparent remaining ailments,
he declared the conclusion of my treatment.

> But don't be mistaken. Your condition is still serious,
> and you won't be able to move in many ways you would have before.
> In fact,
> I have to admit that there are some personal reasons for your early release.

> Personal reasons?

> There's one person in particular, who is the reason.
> She's been busy for a while, but has now become more bothersome,
> saying that you have agreed to continue your work as a scout.
> It may be best for you to meet her, and make a choice for yourself.
> I would advise you to rest for longer, but won't force you to do so,
> now that you are well able to move on your own.

> There are things I don't have any right to interfere with.

As he made this concession, his eyes wandered,
stopping next to my head, where a box still remained.
Having tried my best to stay conscious of its presence for the last few days,
I wouldn't fail to put it to use a second time.

> Yes. I should, at the very least, meet her.

While I appreciated Sutarbi's concerns,
I lacked the knowledge required to make an informed decision.
I anticipated the remnants of my injuries to be of little concern for me,
who focused on the direct use of mana as a weapon.
No. Not only that. I wanted to act.
Having been bound to this bed for all too long,
I felt as though I had been loosing ground.
Getting to a state where I would be able to defend myself was not so trivial
as to be achievable from within the safety of temple.
I needed to train, and Auli had offered to train me.

> Then I will leave you to get ready for departure.
> And I have brought some items of clothing.

> Thank you.

A man whom I had never met before, who had spent hours caring for me
throughout the past few days, refusing any sort of reimbursement.
They were actions unlike those of any man of faith I had known before,
who used the words of their gods as justification for their own selfish goals.
Just like those others, however,
I knew his actions to be contingent on some outside factor.
In his case, it was my citizenship.
While Auli had told me about its controversial nature,
I hadn't been sure about the extent of what this status implied.
To me, it implied a debt. An implicit one, making me wary.

Still, I had accrued a significant amount of debt towards these people,
who had cared for me, regardless of the reasons for this help.
It was obvious to expect recompense from those
to which support had been extended.
In that sense, I had been a great gamble on their part.
Supporting those who had nothing, and no ability to show for,
could result in them being unable to provide any payment at all.
I, who had not only displayed my lack of funds,
but had also just received a permanent debilitation,
could not have expected anyone to raise me up.

Having decided to indulge them until this matter was repaid to my satisfaction,
I went to inspect that which had been left for me.
A neat stack of cloth had been placed on the chair next to my bed,
among which some red fabric was visible.
The top item had long sleeves and the cut of the upper garments of the locals,
and below it, I found a matching pair of trousers.
I picked up the latter,
pulling them out from the pile with a jolting motion with my remaining hand,
and started the arduous process of putting them on.
While I did so, I couldn't help but be distracted by what had lain beneath.

The cloak, which I had brought here as little more than a clump of earth,
had regained its original vibrance of crimson and gold.
Where it had previously been torn and cut, barely retaining its cohesion,
it was now repaired.
Affording it some more attention almost resulted in me falling
with my trousers at my knees,
but allowed me to make out some holes where pieces of cloth were missing,
and the barely visible seams, where it had been joined together.
For now, I left it be, even after I managed to maneuver my way into the pants.

Before I went on to the remaining pieces of clothing,
there was something else I had sworn to not forget. The feather.
I had been planning for how to best fulfill the condition put forth by Fate,
ensuring the artifact's efficacy, leading to me picking it up bare chested.
For it to take effect, it ought to be attached to a body upon its death.
A more complicated procedure than the description suggested,
with most deaths being either sudden, or impossible to precisely pinpoint,
forcing me to attach it to my body before anything had happened at all,
and keeping it in place.

As preparation, I unwound the bandage left around my abdomen.
It was kept there to support the healing of the scab,
but I doubted its removal to have much of a negative influence,
and I had a more important use for it.
Once the wrap was undone, I took the feather out of its box.
I pointed it upwards and held it under my right arm,
placing it flat along my body, then stabbed its tip under my skin.
Not wanting blood to spill onto my new clothes, I made haste,
and held the bandage to the insertion point.
Pressing it down with my arm, I wrapped it around my chest,
making sure to cover the entirety of the feather.

I had expected the artifact's presence to be perceptible,
but felt no change, other than the pain from the wound.
Still, I was satisfied with the placement of my gift,
and went on to finish dressing myself.
I found my shoes below the chair, in the same condition I had last seen them,
except for having been cleaned, and my belt had been placed under the cloak.
No vials were left in the compartments they would have fit in,
most likely having all broken during my struggle in the jungle.

Fully dressing myself was much harder than it would have been with two hands,
especially concerning the belt, but it was still manageable.
Once done, I was ready to head out to join up with Sutarbi,
who had been waiting on the other side of the door.
With the cloak clamped under my arm I left the room,
where he turned to me and looked me over.

> How does everything fit?

> It's perfect.

> Don't be too quick to make your judgement.
> You will most likely be traveling through the jungle like this.
> Getting caught on something can be fatal, so it really needs to fit perfectly.

This comment coming from a priest caught me by surprise.
It hadn't been something I had even considered,
showing my inexperience as an adventurer.
I certainly couldn't argue with his logic, and checked for any loose portions.
I only found the end of my right sleeve dangling.

> It may be best to tie this up somehow.

Responding to my analysis with a smile and a nod,
Sutarbi produced a piece of string from a pocket.
He then proceeded to tie the sleeve closed,
in a similar fashion to how he had bandaged that same arm.

> Yes, good catch. Many veterans choose to do so.
> These are the sorts of things you will have to pay attention to from now on.

This prepared string, and the accurate measurements of the clothes,
gave me the impression that the priest had kept this in mind all along.

> With this, are you prepared?

> Yes, thank you. Would you perhaps know where I could find Auli,
> since you mentioned her wanting to talk to me?

> I was planning to take you there.
> I should head there anyway,
> and I suspect you haven't spent much time in the city,

> I haven't.

> Then follow me.

Sutarbi walked ahead through the narrow stone hallway
passing by the room I had spent my recovery in.
Doors, similar to mine, were placed
along the same side of the passage at regular intervals.
Some of the rooms they led to housed people, usually laying down.
I assumed them to serve as housing for the sick, just like mine had done for me,
since I doubted that any people of the temple would rest at this time.
Telling the exact time in this underground facility wasn't feasible,
but the activity of the inhabitants provided some insight.

Passing by some of these inhabitants,
who all shared the same style of grey garb, brought us to the end of the tunnel,
where stairs were carved into the wall, leading up.
The stone of the tunnel appeared to be entirely connected,
as if it was carved into a single rock,
rather than constructed from multiple smaller ones.
The homogony of the walls was only interrupted where veins of alternate
materials grew through them, creating streaks of white or brown
in patterns much to intricate to be intentional.
Some changes did appear in the basic grey, however, as we ascended the stairs,
and a more porous nature replaced the smooth consistency.

Roughly two ordinary stories higher, the stairs ended,
leading into an enormous structure large enough for a few barns to fit inside.
The structure was similar to temples to the gods I had seen before,
but differed in that it wasn't closed at all.
Three sides of the building had entrances as wide as the structural integrity
could possibly allow, with neither doors nor gates blocking them.
Instead, people flooded in and out of the hall unobstructed.
Altogether, it gave more of an impression of a town square than a temple,
with the building itself serving mainly as a ceiling.

This image was only rectified by the actions of the passing people,
and the statues strewn throughout the interior.
Most were placed on some sort of pedestal, or surrounded by some few stairs,
to elevate them above the crowd, and people gathered before them,
kneeling to prey, or talking among themselves.
I saw one man instruct a child in cleansing one of the smaller statues,
which had no other worshipers around it,
leading me to notice the general cleanliness of the stonework.
Though porous and rough, neither the statues nor the building
had the slightest green taint of moss,
which covered the entire entrance of the city.

> Are sermons held here?

> Sermons?

> Ceremonies where a priest speaks to the masses concerning the gods.

Sutarbi stopped, and turned his head to look at the passing people.
Once I caught up, to stand next to him, he faced me.

> Only the gods have the right to voice their concerns.

He responded as if baffled by the premise.

> Then what is the purpose of this place?

> This is a home for the gods, and their servants.
> As with any other home, it is a place where they can be visited.
> Many come here to talk. Telling a god about what has happened,
> sharing their suffering or joy.
> Others show thanks for blessings they have gotten in the past.

> But these are mere statues.
> Astonishing as the craftsmanship may be,
> why would the gods hear anyone here more so than anywhere else?

> I believe that the gods will hear us everywhere,
> but we, as people, desire a face to talk to.
> You, too, are welcome here any time.

> I will keep it in mind.

> Do not feel forced. As with any friend or companion,
> it is your choice to be with them.

> Now, let us continue. Auli is waiting.

We left the place I had no plans of returning to, through the far exit.
As we passed by the many statues,
I noticed one carved to the size of a cat, and resembling one in form,
except for its wings of a bird and the face of a woman.
The features of the face were clearly once more pronounced,
but now barely present.
Still, I recognized this servant of the gods,
and instinctually placed my hand at my flank, where her feather remained.

> We priests may not speak for them, but we do answer questions about the gods,
> whenever anyone brings them to us, you know. And their servants as well.

My reaction didn't go unnoticed.

> I'm good, thank you.

> Have you heard of her? Fate, the undying sphynx?
> She is very important where you have come from, right now,
> since she chooses the hero.
> When she chose a hero, not long ago, people knew of the coming danger,
> and she has never been wrong, which is why she is called Fate.

> Hasn't a hero died before?

> That is true, but they still did their part to help the next hero win.

> As sacrifices?

> Have you not gone into the forest to kill treelins, knowing of the danger?
> Many die to help protect so many more.

> I don't claim to know the future. She does.
> So she sends them to their deaths knowingly.

> Hmm… Her knowledge is not her claim. It is that of humans.
> I would like to think that I would choose to be sent to my death alone,
> if it meant others would survive.
> This may be what makes a hero.

> Didn't you say that Auli was waiting?

> Yes. I am sorry for rambling.

I thought his assumptions regarding the traits of a hero to have been
quite close to the truth, but for reasons far from those he had had in mind.
I believed the willingness to die to be required
in order to properly serve as a pawn for the sphynx to control.
Many had failed before my eyes from their lack of determination,
leading them to hesitate.
The last hero, on the other hand,
had failed from his lack of hesitation, instead.
He, too, had become a sacrifice.

Having left the temple, the crowd around us cleared up,
