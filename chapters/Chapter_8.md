# Company

Auli explained how our pretend familial relationship was the method
they had exploited to allow for my expeditious acceptance into the city.
Joining her in this lie was apparently the man who had taken care of me earlier,
who, among other things, served as a priest and healer in this temple.
I was also assured the secrecy of our companions in the jungle,
in a claim brimming with confidence.
It made me question the means used to achieve this unanimous agreement,
but I had nether the chance, nor the intent to voice these concerns.

The conversation then quickly diverged into an introduction
to the city's amenities and offerings I now had access to.
Auli's almost unfiltered expression of her train of thought
made it a difficult explanation to follow,
but the enthusiasm she displayed throughout,
made it an enjoyable experience on the whole.
Having been alone with my thoughts for the extent of time that I had,
I also appreciated the company she provided,
especially now that I was unable to distract myself with physical activities.

Eventually the food and water,
promised to me by the man I now knew as Sutarbi, was brought,
interrupting Auli's tales of bathhouse antics, which she had moved on to.
The appearances of the two priests I had now met were quite similar,
differing mainly in their hair and strength of aura.
While Sutarbi's head was bald, this man had short black locks,
and their auras were simply incomparable.

The two guests in my room shared a brief exchange of words unfamiliar to me,
throughout which the priest showed a wide smile.
Auli, on the other hand, had had such a smile for most of her visit,
while she had told tales of places to see, and foods she had eaten.
I opted to use their talk as a chance to eat
the baked goods and various fruits I had received.
Afterwards the man left, and I listened to Auli once again,
until I drifted off into sleep, tired from the food,
and still not nearly recovered from my wounds.

By the time I awakened once more, I was alone,
but found a plate of food placed on a chair next to my bed.
Both the presence of new food and my sore back
hinted at the extensive length of my sleep,
and so did the lack of presences passing the door.
It must have been night.
I was, once again, left with nothing to do, but now that time was abundant,
I began to consider the implications of what Auli had told me.

A new life awaited me. I had known that it would be in turmoil,
when I had decided to take the path of an adventurer,
but the last few days' events had taken it
into a direction I had never considered.
On the surface, few things differed, but it wasn't a purely semantic change.
I had become a citizen of Hest.
In a way, following Fate's command to find allies,
but more realistically, forcing innocents into danger by association.

I doubted any possibility of the immortal's direct implication.
She, too, was fallible, as proven by her plan to have me become an adventurer,
and her protégé's crushing defeat.
Fate's plan, ironically, had been thwarted by my fate.
My fate to hunt treelins, my fate to be injured, and finally,
my fate to become a citizen.
That was, at least, how I chose to reassure myself
of her lack of involvement in my current situation.
That I hadn't doomed Hest by my presence.

Thoughts such as these captivated me,
sending me tumbling through fictitious scenarios, each worse than the last.
Each leading me nowhere.
In order to break this cycle of horror,
I tried to force my mind on something useful.
I eventually succeeded when I remembered the
surplus of magical power I had acquired.
Instead of worrying about some future to come,
it allowed me to have a hand in it myself, as my weapon of choice.
With complete annihilation of a demon as my final goal,
there was an overwhelming difference of might for me to overcome.
And so I did the only thing I could, besides think, and practiced my magic.

Magical applications within one's own body,
like the soul sight I was making extensive use of,
were inherently limited in their possible effects.
Useful, but ultimately not enough.
I needed to control mana which had escaped the imagined bounds of my flesh,
branching out from its usual path, and acting as an extension of my influence.
To this end, I started to construct a support structure of mana
reminiscent of the one supplying energy to my eyes,
only grew from the tips of my fingers, instead of inwards.

Though the effect was entirely invisible,
I was still able to feel the arcane power leave one finger and enter another.
The surprise from the sudden jolt of energy
broke my concentration on the fragile structure.
Opposed to the spell I was so accustomed to,
this guidance wasn't capable of supporting itself, to stand on its own.
Repeating the experiment resulted in a more stable flow,
until I moved the affected fingers, breaking it.

Knowing what the interaction was supposed to feel like,
I repeated it over and over,
modifying the exact application of magic for each try.
As I came closer to my desired outcome with every attempt
I let myself be absorbed by the practice,
pushing out the thoughts which plagued me as much as I could.
Enthralled by the process, I was ignorant of my surroundings,
leaving me surprised at the approaching guest.

> She's taken a toll on you, hasn't she?

The priest Sutarbi stood next to my bed,
holding the same bag he had brought for his last visit.

> I have made sure she knows the weight of your injuries,
> and will respect the time you will take to heal from now on.

> It wasn't as issue. I rather appreciated her visit, in fact.

> No, it was. You, too, have been reckless, pushing yourself to stay awake.
> Had I known, I would have sent her away much sooner.

> I'm sorry.

> Don't be. It is my domain to educate you on this.
> Doing better from now on is all I can ask of you.

> I'll strife to take my condition into account going forward.

My promise gave rise to a small smile on the man's face.

> My child, your lies are clear to see for even those who have lost their sight,
> and clear to hear for even those who have lost their minds.

The calm, but blunt, reply made my heart sink in an instant.
I hadn't lied, I thought,
but certainly couldn't be said to have spoken the truth either.

> Being her brother, on the other hand,
> seems to be a lie you will tell without causing any doubt.
> You both are driven to go further than you should.
> In fact, you should be sleeping as we speak,
> given the amount of herbs applied to your wounds.

> Well, I should uses the chance to apologize myself.
> When we last spoke, I mentioned your citizenship, but didn't explain.
> I did so knowing it would cause you discomfort,
> selfishly pushing that duty to Auli.
> For that, I am sorry.

I thought of how to respond to this unexpected topic,
but didn't have a chance to, as Sutarbi moved on right away.

> I should also use the chance to increase the dosage of medicine you receive,
> since you have proven your resistance to its effect.
> Hold out your arm.

With my bandages changed, I felt a fog return to my thoughts,
which I had felt when I had awakened before.
At my physician's behest, I was able to eat most of the food I had been given,
but fell into a deep slumber shortly after.
It was a slumber with few interruptions.
Fruits were to me, while I was half asleep,
and I barely noticed the regular changings of my dressings.
No matter how much I tried to practice the use of my mana whenever I woke up,
I only found myself drift away as soon as I did.
