# A rough start

Birds tweeted. Trees rustled. Tranquil solitude descended upon me.
I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath.
The air filling my nostrils had an almost meditative effect.
Taking in my surroundings revealed only serenity.
It was nice.
Eventually, I returned to my feet.
Choosing one's own path came with the burden of responsibility.
I had to move. Sadly.

I decided to start walking.
Without any sense of direction, there wasn't much deliberation.
Forward.
Having escaped so far, I wasn't intending on letting myself be caught up to.
The teleportation trap had few patterns in it's choice of targets,
but it's range was still limited.
Direct pursuit through it was impossible,
but I likely remained in the same forest.
Leaving this region, and eventually the kingdom, was inevitable.

Travelling this far wasn't trivial.
Many things would be required.
Rations, clothing, transportation.
Most of it required money.
I looked like a beggar. I had the resources of one too.
If money was needed for my goals, I had to acquire some.
I sighed.

Ways to make money were boundless, but most weren't an option for me.
Nether time nor skill was afforded to me.
What remained was trading.
It meant I had to gather things of value.
Likely through hunting.
Most things I was capable of collecting otherwise had little value.
Meat was valuable in any case.
If I didn't stumble across a village, it would be essential.
Lack of a weapon made this difficult, but, I hoped, not impossible.

Creatures of the forest were stealthy and fast.
I was nether.
Only one method elevated me above a common mouse.
I had magic.
Limited as ability was, the spell I had learned was perfect.
Circumventing stealth left my targets with superior speed.
Most of them. I only had to catch one.

The diversity of creatures in my surroundings had been
revealed to me for a short moment, when I arrived here.
Quickly afterwards, I had stopped concentrating on my spell,
but it had been enough to leave an impression.
Remembering the process I had gone through once before,
I started gathering my mana. Slowly, it reacted.
Shapes came into focus, where none had been.
It worked.
The forest lit up.

Overwhelming. That was the only way to describe it.
In every leaf, under every rock, within every bark, there was life.
Every one barely out of sight for humans.
Not for me.
Taking in the hustle around me, I stood still.
Like a city of animals of various sizes, they spread out.
It was too much.
Beautiful as it was, it was chaos.
With everything to see, nothing could be found.
Not every bug was important to me.
It wasn't food. It couldn't be sold.

Changing my plans, I focused once again.
Having been the one that constructed the spell,
there would be nothing in my way to change it.
Affecting the behavior needed deeper involvement,
but I only changed the magnitude.
Essentially, it was no different to squinting.
Lowering the fuel to sustain the spell, I barely maintained the structure.
Auras faded. Some calm returned.

> There we go.

The presences that remained were only the strongest.
Birds, mice, squirrels.
Faint as their presences now were, they were clear to make out.
These were my targets.
Residing far up in trees or in the underbrush made them hard to reach.
Still, I was satisfied.
A way had been paved, now I only needed to walk it.

I resumed my hike.
Critters sped by many times. I failed to catch them just as often.
Eventually growing frustrated from the attempts,
I learned of my true inferiority.
Healthy creatures weren't within my grasp.
Left were only those with some restriction.
Those who couldn't flee, being trapped or asleep.
I looked toward the trees.
Eggs.

While not my original intent, I had confidence.
Lacking souls didn't make them entirely undetectable.
Granted, some deduction and luck were probably necessary,
but the mind was a human's greatest weapon.
It was time to put mine to the test.
Closely observing the birds above, I found a few that moved little.
Most were unreachable with my climbing abilities.
I would find out for the rest.

Approaching a tree, I imagined my ascent.
Dense, thick branches adorned it.
A good first choice.
Before my climb, I looked for one more thing.
The shaking tree would likely scare off the bird,
making me loose track of the nest.
Since I couldn't see the nest from where I stood,
I found some unique sections around it as references.
With these in mind, I grabbed the first branch.
Contorting my body through the gaps allowed me to slowly close in.
I found a nest.

Left behind by it's inhabitant, a defenseless nest greeted me.
I eagerly pulled myself towards it.
Lifting my head just above, it became clear. There were eggs.
Three small eggs, barely wider than my thumb, waited.
The amount was small, but the method proven.
Repeating these steps would allow me to build a stock.
I wrapped the fruits of my labor in the cloth previously on my waist,
and started my descent.

Back on the ground, I repeated the process.
Focusing on trees with ease of access was enough,
given the efficiency of my search.
Not every bird led to a nest, of course, and not every nest had eggs,
but with experience, I gained some insight into the motions of the auras I saw.
By the time I had gathered more than a dozen eggs, it seemed sufficient.

Enriched by my efforts, I continued my trek.
The environment had changed little during my hunt.
A bolder. A few streams. Not much broke the monotonous landscape.
Flowing down a slight decline,
the biggest stream I had encountered yet now led me.
Even at half a mere arm's length wide, it supplied water nonetheless.
Water that was vital to life.

Washing myself was also possible. I chose not to.
Uncomfortable as the mud and dirt were, they concealed my identity.
Many knew my face. The hero had made sure of that.
Drawings were likely present in any village I would find,
but even a king would not be recognized in my current condition.
A change of clothes may help with this further.
Another reason for the need of funds.

In time, the stream joined a river.
Vegetation flourished by it's sides, both hiding and highlighting it.
I stuck by the line of tall grass.
It passed different sections of forest, as it went on.
Rocky ground, hills, clearings. Some easier to traverse than others.
Then, finally, what I had hoped for.
Trees thinned around me, the sun, now low in the sky, warmed my skin.
I had left the forest.

Greeting me, were overgrown hills. Over them, smoke. Civilization.
I hoped for humans. Goblins had a much lower affinity for trade.
Climbing a hill, I found my hope fulfilled.
A farm, lit by the sunset spread out slightly below me.
Crudely woven fences marked it's border.
Within lay a barn and a small house, which was the origin of the smoke.
Dirt tracks led from the house to a gate in the fence.

Approaching the gate, I took a closer look at the inhabitants.
I had already noticed a single person's soul in the house,
but the barn was more complicated.
Many currently resided within, making it hard to make out individuals.
It was comparable to the silhouette of a group.
The size hinted at larger animals, like cows, bunched together.

> Hey!

A sharp voice interrupted my investigation.
The spell's effect vanished in my surprise.

> Whaddaya lingerin' around for?

Approaching me was a tall man with thin grey hair.
Not feeble, but marked by years of manual labor.

> Uh…

> Spit it out boy, I ain't got time for a thief.

A thief? I had no such intentions.

> No! I was looking to barter.

> Barter? You?

His eyes wandered over my body, lingering momentarily on my makeshift bag.
Holding the cloth up with both hands, I revealed the contents.
Having walked closer to the fence, we now stood on opposite sides of,
he saw my collection before raising his gaze back up to meet mine.
It held skepticism.

> You collected these, didja?

I nodded. A few moments of silence passed, before he let out a sigh.

> There's quite a few of 'em…
> Look, kid. I can't buy these. I can't buy bird eggs.

Outright rejection. My arms dropped.

> Who knows how long they've been sittin' there, ya know.
> Could be half a bird in one o' those.

> I assure you, they're entirely edible.
> The nutritional value of the contents remains high through the growth process.

He seemed surprised.
It wasn't common to eat a partially formed chicken,
my claim had likely been news to him.
He signed again.

> If you're a runaway noble's kid, it'd be better for ya to go back, ya know.

> I'm no noble's child.

Somehow, I had gained a false identity in the man's mind.
While I thought my clothe's quality to be well hidden,
they weren't completely hidden.

> Have ya ever fought a goblin?
> If you're strollin' through the forest like that, you'll meet em'.

> I've encountered a pack before.
> Without a weapon, I had to lure them into danger.

> Hm… You know, I won't buy the eggs,
> but if you're tellin' the truth,
> I might have somethin' for ya to do.
> I could at least get you a fresh set o' clothes for your troubles.

> See, there's been goblins around. Snatchin' chickens 'n calves.
> I'm not sayin' for you to go and kill 'em all.
> You'd just stand guard with a pitchfork for the night.
> They tend to come alone, from what I can tell.

An enticing offer.
Benefiting from great reach,
a pitchfork was a formidable weapon against the short goblins.
Quickly blending in with the local population was exactly what I needed,
thus making it a night well spent.
A small detail remained.

> What about the possessions of any goblin I were to vanquish?

> As long as it's not stolen from here, I don't care what you do with it.
> If you kill even a single goblin, I'll get you some clothes.
> It oughta scare the rest of 'em off.
> So, how 'bout it?

> Yes. With these conditions, I can help tonight.

Extending his hand with a slight smile, he initiated a handshake.
I accepted.

> Name's Greg.

> I'm…

My name. Did I still remember?
For years I had no use for it. No reason to remember.

> S'pose it doesn't matter.

> I'm Martin.

> Huh… Same name as the hero, eh? Let's go with that then.
> Anyway, come on in.

So that's what it was.
As I pondered over the name that had come to mind, the gate was opened.
Two tracks led through the dirt, likely formed by wagon wheels.
Leading me towards the barn, Greg turned to look at me.

> I'll introduce you to a boy from the village.
> Hired him to do the same job,
> but he can't look after the whole barn alone.
> We tried tried that a few days now, but they're still stealin'.

> You can take one of those buckets there,
> and fill it in the river for water, if you want.
> Oh, and if you hand me those eggs, I'll get 'em cooked up for you.
> You gotta be starvin'.

> I've eaten.

> Your choice.

I was nether hungry nor tired.
Invigorated by the many elixirs I had consumed,
I anticipated not needing any sleep for a few days.
Healing was the main effect, but all ailments vanished from the concoction,
natural or otherwise. Legends told of it for good reason.

Circling around the barn, we arrived at a gate
big enough to let cows pass through, but currently closed.
In front of it stood a young man, who must have just reached adulthood.
Our approach made him pause from his work,
hammering a piece of wood into a gap of the door.

> Oh, who's that?

> I met this youngin just now. His name's Martin, he'll be helpin' you tonight.
> How 'bout you watch the front, and he can watch the back?

> Works for me.

While seemingly surprised by my appearance, he quickly accepted it,
going back to the work we had interrupted him from.
The door had similar pieces jammed into other areas already, likely blocking it.

> Great! I'll be off then.
> Martin, you can grab a pitchfork from the back.
> They'll only show up after it's all dark.
> Get yourself set up till then.

> Yes.

Greg returned from where we came, presumably entering the house.
Apparently satisfied with the rigidity of the piece he had worked on,
my partner turned around to me.
I stopped, having just planned to inspect my post.

> There's a firepit back there.
> I set it up a few days ago, so you might as well use it too.
> I'll bring some fire after I've gone and ate,
> but you're gonna need to get some branches yourself.
> The forest's not too far off.
> The door here leads to the cows, and you'll look after the chicken coop.
> There's also the tools back there.

> The old man told me none o' that, when I first started.
> Been here for too long, I'd say. Only talking to his wife, if that.
> It's like they know what they wanna say, without saying it.
> I'm Ben, by the way.

> Martin. Thank you for the help.

Ben chuckled at his comment about the owners of the farm.

> The old couple tends to the farm during they day,
> so they hired me to stay up at night.
> I get to live here, for doing it.
> Well, I'm about to head off to eat. See you later.

Nodding in response I resumed my walk around the structure.
Weathered wood left no gaps through which light could enter.
Noises of the animals had little trouble penetrating the walls,
proving the presence of cows.
Having reached the other side, I found a smaller door.
Around it, the ground was compressed from use,
and an area encircled in rocks held ashes from a burnt-out fire.
I ignored it and opened the door to the barn.

Little light entered the building, but chickens could be seen fluttering about.
Pitchforks and other tools were barely visible next to the entrance.
After taking what I had entered for, I didn't linger and left.
I felt better.
Holding the farming tool in both hands,
I felt better able to take on anything that might come.
Many wizards held staffs they didn't require. I now understood why.
Stabbing the air a few times gave me confidence to pierce a foe.

The night would soon arrive, but I had some time, as I had been told.
Two things came to mind, for how I could prepare.
Fetching water was one. The other could be done on the way.
So I did just that.
Bucket in hand, I headed back to the river that had guided me for so long.
While walking, I concentrated on my mana.

Experience showed it's effects, as the spell I had grown so familiar with
was formed more easily than before.
I was happy with the result, but not yet satisfied.
Constant movement of mana required constant concentration,
concentration that was easily interrupted.
Calling a spell like this done was like calling a house built,
while holding up the roof.
Attempting to modify the spell's structure, I returned to the farm.
It failed.

Ben had already left, when I passed the front of the barn.
Paying it little mind, my attention remained on experimentation.
Any tool one had was important,
thus making it worthwhile for me to spend my spare time on enhancing this one.
Back at the door assigned to me, I looked over the fields, focusing inward.

Allowing a circuit to maintain it's structure
required a direct connection to tap into my flow of mana.
Such a connection itself needed to be stable,
using parts of the mana it diverted.
In the end, this lead to a higher consumption of mana.
Mana of which I commanded very little.

Countless failures followed, while the sun disappeared.
Every failure being more efficient. Closer to my goal.
Standing guard was simple enough for such a distraction.
Before falling apart, every iteration functioned for longer,
giving some insight into my surroundings.
With the fields as a buffer form any potential attack,
I felt safe with the limited usage of the spell I received.

> Damn it's dark.

I flinched. Ben's voice announced his unexpected visit.
Holding a burning branch in one hand, he looked around the corner.
Having been focused on the field and my magic, I hadn't noticed his approach.

> Ah, there you are.
> It's so dark over here, I went and thought you'd left.
> Thought I'd check on you, since you didn't come to get fire for yourself.

> I'm good, thank you.

> It's gonna be a long night, if you don't have any fire, you know.
> Look, if you want, I can lend you some firewood.
> I've got more than I need for the night,
> and you can just get some for me tomorrow.

> Thank you for the offer, but I don't need a fire.
> In case of an attack, the light will make it hard to adjust to the darkness.

> Are you sure, it gets real scary after a while.

> Being attacked by the imperceptible truly is scary.
> I'll make sure it won't happen.

> If you say so…

> If you're good, I'mma head back.

Following the short conversation with the boy,
my training continued for a few hours without any meaningful progress.
Only so many redundancies were present in the spell.
Only so much I could save, before it collapsed.
Like an intricately balanced house of cards, only the framework remained.
Yet still, there weren't enough cards in my deck.
Then, a change happened.

Not internally, but externally. On the field.
A sign of life appeared in the distance,
growing closer with slow, but steady movements.
Hunching into a crouch, the figure of a child become clearer,
as the distance shrank.
Moving directly towards me, it's goal was clear.
Now was time for me to get ready,
while direct sight between us was still blocked by the grass it hid between.

Outright confrontation was always dangerous.
Arming oneself helped, but I intended to grasp any advantage I could get.
Thinking this, I opened the door behind me,
entering while making at little sound as possible.
That night, I planned to get the darkness on my side.
Keeping my eyes on the encroaching creature,
I closed the door, and waited.

Tension rose within me,
as I watched what had now become clearly distinguishable as a goblin.
It searched around the area I had stood not long before,
presumably looking for things of value to it.
Crafting was rarely taken up among goblins,
but misappropriation of what others had made was well within the norm.
The search was abandoned quickly, and it finally turned to me.
The door opened.

I stabbed, right as the crack was wide enough.
A hit. I felt resistance, then saw the arm bend away.
Screeching followed.
The arm I had thought to be pierced flailed wildly,
knocking my pitchfork to the side.
While I tried to recover it's position,
the goblin leapt through the door, in my direction.
It fell, unable to locate me.
I took this chance, stabbing through the goblin, into the ground.

Heavy breathing was drowned out by the cackling of chickens.
The twitching at my feet came to a stop, as life drained from the body.
I watched that very life rise up. It would go on to be reborn.
Then, the unexpected happened. The figure floating towards me tore.
Portions were drained from the soul by an unknown force.
What remained recoiled from the process,
leaving some bits of itself darting towards me.

I fell backwards, trying to escape from the soul fragments,
but they penetrated my body before I had any chance to move.
Looking down on myself, I noticed no visible change.
I moved my fingers. They responded.
It hadn't taken control.

> Martin, are you all right? Shit!

Torchlight entered the room. Ben came with it.
He looked down to me, who sat on the ground.
The details of the scene I had caused revealed themselves.
A pitchfork, stuck in the wooden boards next to me feet,
held a goblin in it's tines.
It's entrails spread out, letting blood escape to seep into the wood.

> You're shaking all over! Did it get you anywhere?

> I… I am?

I clenched my fists, trying to stop my arms from shivering. They didn't stop.
Nothing stopped them. Every attempt to regain control worsened my condition.

> Hey, calm down!

I had been naïve. I had thought myself safe.
I had thought being able to see a threat would be enough.
Now, my body had ceased to listen to any of my commands.
Damning myself for my failure to fight back,
I lost control of my breathing.
Every short breath that remained felt increasingly suffocating.

Something touched my hand. Knuckles seemed to try to escape the skin.
Being pulled up by that hand, I almost tumbled forward.
I was caught, then pulled up again.
My legs extended below me, allowing me to barely stand.

> Take a deep breath. You're gonna fall over if you don't.

Ben, holding on to me with both arms, instructed me.
Like I was told, I forced my lungs to inflate.
My jaw quivered, letting the air pass through.

> Good. Now out again. And just keep going.

Following his guidance, I repeated those steps over and over.
At some point my shivers had stopped.
I tested my movement.
Moving my thumb, I touched the tip of every other finger.
Calm returned.

> That's better.

> Yes. Thank you.

> You keep saying that.

> What?

> 'Thank you.'

> I say it with sincerity. You are kind, yet I have no way to repay you.

> Huh… You're weird. I'd even started thinking you weren't human, you know.
> Like an elf, or something. But you gotta be human.

> What makes you say that?

> You're like my brother.
> Toughest bastard I know, but sometimes he gets like that.

I fell into thought.
Being compared to someone's brother felt odd, much more so than an elf.
Even I hadn't seen an elf before, but I didn't feel human ether.
I wasn't sure if I still was.
Reflecting on what had just transpired,
I judged it to have been the devouring of a soul.
Common between demons.
Weather humans were capable of it, I didn't know.

> Looks like you killed it.
> Let's throw it on the fire. It's gonna smell the place up pretty bad.

Carrying corpse was a cumbersome task.
The reward was worse.
Fire engulfed the flesh, spreading a poisonous odor.
We stood guard together, watching the flames the rest of the night.
Eventually my partner's complaints about the smoke fell silent,
and he fell asleep shortly after.
My mind still lingered on the events of the day before,
by the time the sun rose.
It marked the end of my first day of freedom.
