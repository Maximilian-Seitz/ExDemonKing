# A first job

I had been wrong.
I had thought of the appearance of a soul as an expression of one's self image,
but I had to admit that there was more to it.
The sphynx had claimed that humans, too, fed on the souls of their slain foes,
a fact I had little hope of refuting, once I stepped through the tunnel.

Welcoming me was a wave of auras, as soon as I stepped through the door.
I had, of course, seen many an aura, of those who lead others into battle,
those who gave their lives to save others, those who braved grand foes alone,
and, strongest among them, the hero.
Still, they had never been this concentrated.
A champion on the battlefield was one among hundreds,
and two would rarely fight side by side.

I had been wrong in believing their presences
to have come from the situations they had faced.
Battle, after all, demands from us everything we have.
So much so, that most of these idols I had seen had perished shortly after.
How was it then, that these auras were emitted deep within a city?
Was it truly that these slayers of demons had taken in parts of their strength?

As my eyes adjusted to the unforeseen stimulation,
I became able to take in the details of my new surroundings.
The first thing I noticed was the distribution of the auras.
Rather than presenting as a homogenous clump,
strength was focused on some, few, individuals.
Next was the physical.

The room I found myself in was just a few steps into the tunnel,
and looked like it had been carved into the stone.
No door blocked access to establishment,
but I suspected it to be the safest location in the country nonetheless.
Though it may have been the most dangerous for some, myself possibly included.
It's furnishing resembled that of a tavern, and so did it's size.
Only it's height was lacking,
resulting in an oppressive atmosphere, similar to that of a prison.
Light, while dim, was being shed by stones embedded into the walls and ceiling.

The guests were people of various lands,
many showing features found neither here nor in the region I had hailed from.
This wasn't surprising, as adventurers were, in the end, travelers,
not bound to any place, but also not claiming any as their home.
And so it was here that they gathered, drinking away their earnings at this bar,
trying to forget the hardships they had faced, and the friends they had lost.
An adventurer's life was cheap, after all.

The strength displayed by most in this room wasn't much
greater than that of an ordinary person, perhaps even less.
Few took up the profession for the thrill of battle, rather,
they were forced to take up this life, left with no other choice.
Every child knew this.
Every child knew to stay away from those who had nothing to loose.
Those who would risk their lives for the money needed for their next drink.

I was no different from them.
I, too, had nowhere else to turn, and no other way to acquire food.
I, too, had risked my life for a loaf of bread, and a set of clothes.
Many lost that bet. Would I be different?
I laid claim to a goal that drove me, but so did many others here.
Poverty wasn't the only force that lead people here,
but no sense of pride, or desire for revenge,
would stop the bleeding from a goblin's knife.
