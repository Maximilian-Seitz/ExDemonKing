# A first job

I had been wrong.
I had thought of the appearance of a soul as an expression of one's self image,
but I had to admit that there was more to it.
The sphynx had claimed that humans, too, fed on the souls of their slain foes,
a fact I had little hope of refuting, once I stepped through the tunnel.

Welcoming me was a wave of auras, as soon as I stepped through the door.
I had, of course, seen many an aura, of those who lead others into battle,
those who gave their lives to save others, those who braved grand foes alone,
and, strongest among them, the hero.
Still, they had never been this concentrated.
A champion on the battlefield was one among hundreds,
and two would rarely fight side by side.

I had been wrong in believing their presences
to have come from the situations they had faced.
Battle, after all, demands from us everything we have.
So much so, that most of these idols I had seen had perished shortly after.
How was it then, that these auras were emitted deep within a city?
Was it truly that these slayers of demons had taken in parts of their strength?

As my eyes adjusted to the unforeseen stimulation,
I became able to take in the details of my new surroundings.
The first thing I noticed was the distribution of the auras.
Rather than presenting as a homogenous clump,
strength was focused on some, few, individuals.
Next was the physical.

The room I found myself in was just a few steps into the tunnel,
and looked like it had been carved into the stone.
No door blocked access to establishment,
but I suspected it to be the safest location in the country nonetheless.
Though it may have been the most dangerous for some, myself possibly included.
Its furnishing resembled that of a tavern, and so did its size.
Only its height was lacking,
resulting in an oppressive atmosphere, similar to that of a prison.
Light, while dim, was being shed by stones embedded into the walls and ceiling.

The guests were people of various lands,
many showing features found neither here nor in the region I had hailed from.
This wasn't surprising, as adventurers were, in the end, travelers,
not bound to any place, but also not claiming any as their home.
And so it was here that they gathered, drinking away their earnings at this bar,
trying to forget the hardships they had faced, and the friends they had lost.
An adventurer's life was cheap, after all.

The strength displayed by most in this room wasn't much
greater than that of an ordinary person, perhaps even less.
Few took up the profession for the thrill of battle, rather,
they were forced to take up this life, left with no other choice.
Every child knew this.
Every child knew to stay away from those who had nothing to loose.
Those who would risk their lives for the money needed for their next drink.

I was no different from them.
I, too, had nowhere else to turn, and no other way to acquire food.
I, too, had risked my life for a loaf of bread, and a set of clothes.
Many lost that bet. Would I be different?
I laid claim to a goal that drove me, but so did many others here.
Poverty wasn't the only force that lead people here,
but no sense of pride, or desire for revenge,
would stop the bleeding from a goblin's knife.

I stepped towards the local who stood behind the bar,
having lost the sense of disassociation, I had had in the market.
These were outcasts, so how could I not belong?
The man who's age I couldn't gage,
was engaged in conversation before he noticed my approach, and turned to me.
Beneath his bold head, and smooth skin, lay the soul of a warrior,
not shining golden, like Fate's, but imitating cold, hard steel.
His clothes were, unlike those of the other inhabitants of this city,
quite similar to mine.

> Greetings. I seek employment for an adventurer. Can you help me?

> Rightâ€¦ What's your timetable?

Seemingly sensing my trouble answering, he spoke again.

> How fast do you need the coin?

> My rations have almost run dry. It is rather urgent.

> Ever killed anything before?

> I've slain goblins and slimes.

I felt his analytical look quickly scan me, before he looked through the room,
slightly raised his head, and shouted towards someone.

> Roy, still need another body?

The answer came not verbally, but in the form of a burly man
pushing through some people next to me.
His familiar looking middle aged face was covered in thick stubbles
and accompanied by short black hair.
Clad in leather armor, and adorned with a sword by his hip,
he looked ready for a fight, but his spirit suggested a much harsher reality.
Red. That would be his color, if I had to ascribe one to him.

He didn't radiate his strength in any way,
but it was demonstrated by the details his self-image produced.
An image that mimicked his physical appearance fairly accurately,
only differing in one important way. Blood covered his body.
Much of it clung to him, as if he had just slaughtered a pig,
while other places showed clear scrapes and gashes.
He looked like a last survivor standing on a battlefield.

> 'Bout to head out, but sure.

> You know the details?

Quickly having picked me out as the offered candidate, he addressed me.

> No.

> Well, we go 'round the city, clearing out all the treelins we can find.
> We get a commission for every one we kill.
> Since you don't look like you can fight, you're gonna have to scout.
> It's dangerous, but everyone gets the same pay,
> so you're gonna have to make yourself useful.

> You'll get a sword and some arm-pads lent, even as a scout,
> but you can be a fighter if you want to.
> Not that I'd recommend it, if you can't swing a sword.

If every participant received the same portion of pay,
I expected to receive enough compensation to feed me, at least.
In addition to that, scouting likely fit my abilities.
All in all, it was within the realm of what I had expected.
It seemed acceptable for my first contract.

> Scouting would be acceptable, though I've not heard of treelins before.

> Just think of a furry fuckin' goblin jumpin' through trees.

The thought gave me shivers, but I doubted much easier work was to be found,
so I gave a nod in response to his description.

> All right. Come on.

Waving his hand to follow him, Roy returned through the gap he came by.
Passing some patrons, we arrived at a table surrounded by about ten people,
including my guide.
The group was using the space to prepare for combat, putting on boots,
helping each other don some pieces of armor or inspecting their weapons.
Most of them seemed to be of average strength,
if my assumption about the appearances of souls was correct.

An open chest stood to one side of the table, almost reaching it in height.
Various pieces of equipment were strewn inside,
ranging from weapons and armor to shields and cloaks.
When I arrived, Roy dropped his hand on the brim of the chest,
as if to point it out.

> Grab some arm guards and a sword from here, and put 'em on.
> If you need help, ask someone here.
> We're gonna head out when everyone's ready.

I did as I was told, and searched through the chest.
Finding a pair of fitting, let alone matching, protective pads in this chaos
would take some rummaging, so I inspected the contained weaponry first.
I had never held a proper sword before,
so there wasn't anything specifically I was looking out for.
Still, there was something that caught my eye.
They were all exceptionally short.
Not quite as short as my dagger, but none exceeded thrice its size.

Getting close to a creature as terrifying as a leaping goblin
was already horrifying enough, but doing so
without being able to keep proper distance wasn't something I dared.
Thankfully, the description of my task didn't make it sound like
that was asked from me.
In case I really did need a weapon,
I trusted my dagger to be of more utility than something I hadn't ever used.
Instead of a sword, something else caught my eye.

> Am I correct to assume that I won't have to attack directly?

Roy, who was finishing his preparations next to me, nodded.

> Yup. Sword's just in case.

> Then would it be all right if, instead of a sword, I borrowed this?

After using both hands to extract it from what was piled on top,
I produced a shield from the container.
Scratched leather bound the round wooden board that made up its body.
Two straps were the only other feature it possessed,
but with a width that surpassed my shoulders, I felt somewhat safe behind it.

> Fine by me.
> If you loose it, you're gonna have to make up for it, just so you know.

> Of course. Thank you.

With the shield I only needed a single guard, which I had less trouble finding.
Before I had a chance to try putting it on though, Roy took it from me,
and quickly bound it to my arm.
He then closed the chest we stood next to,
locked it with a heavy key, and pushed it under the table.
What would have been an impressive feat
for an ordinary person looked trivial to him.

It seemed I had held up the group with my preparations,
as everyone started moving once he stood back up, and gave a nod.
I, too, followed.
The group, as a whole,
seemed to know where we were headed without Roy at the charge,
suggesting that this had either been discussed before I had arrived,
or that this was something they had gone through before.

After leaving the building, we descended the stairs and then went sideways,
staying close to the base of the rock.
Walking along this slanted section of the city,
I saw people carrying goods up and down,
and entering and leaving the many openings.
None of it gave me any hint as to some special purpose these had,
or if they were treated just like any other buildings.
The location of the adventurers' gathering spot suggested the latter,
but it, too, wasn't quite an ordinary building.

Following the group I found myself in was exceptionally easy,
even while I was distracted by my surroundings,
from how much they stood out.
There were the souls of the strongest among them, of course,
but even without the help of my spell,
it was clear that these weren't ordinary citizens.
Collectively, we must have looked like a party of invaders,
but this time I drew less attention to myself,
having my companions to share it with.

We soon arrived at the end of the stairs.
To my surprise not all sides were equipped with them,
and we instead found a sheer wall on the edge of the rock.
Opposed to the middle of the city, where we had come from,
barely any people could be found closer to this wall.
Where, there, the forest had been taken over,
here, the jungle started directly adjacent to the cliff.
It felt menacing.

Having a way to flee into the city provided a certain level of safety
which this wall denied.
Anyone flanked by both it and the jungle wanting to flee,
would have to return to this last safe location we were at right now,
since scaling the wall was out of the question.
That was probably why this marked the end of where people set foot.
We also stopped here, catching up to each other.
When I reached the group, Roy faced me.

> Stick with us for now. You're not gonna know what to look out for anyway.
> I'll send you out in the second round.

> It's your job to lure a treelin in. We're gonna kill it.
> Just make sure you only grab one at a time.
> And don't die.

They were welcome instructions, as I had feared having to learn during combat.
In retrospect, I thought that fear to be unfounded,
since I was of more use to them trained, rather than dead.
Looking around, at the other participants,
it seemed only a small portion had followed the conversation.
Among those who hadn't, some looked agitated,
some bored, and some busied themselves.
They mostly gave off the impression of this being standard procedure to them.

It was a comforting sight, but didn't last long.
With a wave of our leader's hand, they began to move,
starting with one of the weaker members,
who charged ahead, into the undergrowth.
Everyone else followed, now very careful and quiet.
As the foliage wrapped around me, I felt my skin crawl,
remembering the multitude of bugs who made it their home.

Our trudge didn't take us far into the woods,
before everyone around me hid between leaves or vines.
Once I caught on, I followed their example,
finding myself a winding tree, covered by a huge fern, to crouch beneath.
Quiet descended upon our location,
and only small physical signs remained of our presence at all.
I would have lost track of my group, if not for their auras giving them away.
It wasn't the auras of the ones around me I was looking out for though,
but the single soul that had left us behind.

My anticipation was soon relieved,
when it came back into sight, along with another being in tow.
The second creature was, just as described, the size of a goblin.
What wasn't like a goblin's, was the movement.
Chaotically jumping from point to point, it gave the impression of a flea
staying off the ground and just behind its target.
A target which was moving directly towards us.

Watching my comrade dashing through the dense forest,
ducking and jumping as he went along,
I resolved myself to stay hidden until combat was over.
My task wasn't to fight, but to follow the example set right now.
Unsure of my ability to mimic the movements displayed here,
anxiety grew within me.
I had run from goblins before, but they were laughable in comparison.

Nobody moved while our foe approached, coming closer and closer.
Even as the scout ran beyond us, everyone stayed quiet,
until the target of our hunt was surrounded, caught within our trap.
Bursting from their hideouts, four of our group trapped the demon.
Then, a slash. A single slash.
That was all it took to tear open the creature's chest, killing it.
A slash so quick that it left me wondering what had happened.

Then, there it lay.
Reddish brown fur covered the corpse from head to finger-like toe.
Other than its size, nothing about it resembled a goblin,
but it was still equally grotesque.
All four of its limbs, much too long for its body,
were endowed with appendages resembling fingers,
but warped by the inclusion of an additional knuckle,
and adorned by a sharp claw.
A tail was visible from behind its back,
long and firm enough to serve as another limb.

None of that was what caused my sense of discomfort at its sight though,
but it revolting maw.
Sharp teeth lay bare, covering the majority of its grimace,
just below two holes that made up its nose.
All of this was accentuated by its beady eyes,
still gleaming with hatred, even after its death.

It hadn't been dead for long, before movement began again.
This time, invisible.
A figure rose from the recently slain body,
reminiscent of the one that left the goblin I had killed.
Remembering back, I braced myself for what was to come.
Then, without the participants' knowledge, a fight started once more.
A fight for the spoils of the battle,
only seen by the suffering of the vanquished demon,
which was being torn at by those around it.

The incorporeal demon, helpless as it was,
didn't let itself be consumed without a fight,
and tried to flee towards the sky.
It looked as though our victim was having pieces of flesh ripped from it,
to be devoured by the humans surrounding it,
before it eventually managed its retreat.
I, too, wasn't spared from taking part in this vicious feast.

I knew of the strength this would lend me, and the adventurers with me,
and saw how it weakened the demon, which would, inevitably, be reborn.
Still, no matter how advantageous the process was, it made me uncomfortable.
No small part of this discomfort stemmed from the fact
that this vocation had been suggested by Fate.
I didn't trust the sphynx's word,
but had to admit that it was in her interest, too, for me to gain strength.

By the time the soul had escaped,
and my attention returned to the physical world,
I saw Roy holding the treelin's severed tail.
Without much pause,
he threw the appendage into an empty bag hanging from his back,
then said something I didn't understand.
It was probably a name, considering the length, but even if it was,
I had never heard any name like it before.

Unaffected by my confusion, however, a scrawny woman, from an unknown land,
responded by moving into the jungle,
just like the previous scout had done before her.
This time, I paid close attention to the example being set.
Her movements were much slower than I had just seen,
but she was currently not being followed.
Instead, she seemed focused on her surroundings,
looking up and around herself, especially towards the tops of the trees.

I watched her for as long as I could, at first directly, then only her aura,
but eventually even that faded, blocked by the thick jungle between us.
It seemed to have been a quirk of the spell,
which hadn't been blocked by much thicker masses of stone in the dungeon,
but I refused to put any more power into it,
opting to stay ignorant of the many bugs around me.
And so I waited, until the second scout, just like the first, came running back.

Not long after I spotted her once more,
I heard another phrase from Roy, and just like last time,
someone left their hiding spot to search through the forest.
The third hunter was long gone once the second returned with her catch.
I expected a similar sequence of events to what I had just beheld,
but this time, when the treelin was jumped, it didn't stop.
Unlike the other, this treelin dodged through the gap between two attackers.

This was all I was able to make out of the battle, from my hideout,
where I only had the appearances of their souls to go off of.
So, when the battle suddenly ended afterwards, I was at a loss,
as I had merely seen the treelin collapse without a clear cause.
Leaving my refuge allowed me to recognize the reality of the situation,
when I saw a woman pulling her knife from the spine of the corpse.
It hinted at terrifying skill.

> Newbie, your turn.

Roy's instruction overlapped with everyone's
glutenous gorging on the emerging soul.
The spectacle made me glad to flee into the trees,
even whilst I felt ill-prepared.
At first my progress was hasty, but I soon slowed to a more methodical search.
My search, however, was not focused up above, but on the path I made for myself.
Trees, roots, bushes,
I looked for every obstacle that would hinder my safe return,
memorizing them as best I could.

The jungle was filled with life.
Birds in the trees, which I ignored, snakes everywhere, which I avoided,
and many other small animals lurking and hiding in the shade.
Peeking beyond these creatures, I spied what I was looking for,
while still within sight of my company.
Gladly accepting this lucky find, I lowered my stance and quieted my steps.
Would I have made noise, I was sure to have drawn in the beast,
but there was one last thing for me to confirm.

With the decreasing distance, I became sure. It was alone.
Not spotting any other hostiles in my vicinity, it was time to make my move.
I broke a branch and let out a grunt, all while keeping my focus.
They weren't blunders on my part, so I kept going,
making increasingly loud sounds, until the treelin reacted.
It maneuvered its way in my direction, slowly at first,
but gaining speed, once it recognized my presence.

I ran. Its attention had been drawn,
so only the return trip remained for a successful first assignment.
I dodged between trees, brushed aside vines, and stepped over roots,
rushing back to the combatants who would kill my pursuer.
Looking back at every opportunity, I was spurred on by my shrinking lead.
Were it to catch up to me, I had little hope of defeating it with
the rusty dagger I had no experience with.
My shield, on the other hand, provided me more protection
from the passing foliage than I anticipated it to help in battle.

Luckily, my worries didn't come to pass.
With some distance remaining, I ran into the location of the ambush.
What I encountered there, however, wasn't what I had thought I would.
Instead of hiding, our fighters stood around their last victim,
which they must have killed while I was gone.
Their surprise mirrored mine, as I passed them,
leaving my worries for them to deal with.

Once I felt safe to turn around, I witnessed the treelin's attack,
as it came flying from above, towards one of the fighters.
Dodging by a hair's breadth, he left the fiend stumbling to the ground,
where it was impaled by Roy's sword.
The targeted combatant left out a curse I couldn't translate,
but still fully understood the meaning of.

> Damn it. That was faster than I thought.

> Should 'a sent you out later.

Our leader's words were the last anyone spoke of the event.
None gave the impression of faulting me for it,
nor did they seem very concerned with it, at all.
And so we moved on.

This first station, now littered with four new corpses,
was left behind, as we moved deeper into the jungle, along the city's wall.
Once we'd moved far enough, the hunt continued just like it had started,
drawing in round after round of treelin.
My own missions also followed the precedent set by the first,
in that I encountered my victims quite close to my backup without fail.
It lead me to conclude that treelins, while probably as prevalent as goblins,
spread out far more evenly, each keeping to themselves.

This hypothesis was only slightly curbed when one of my colleagues
brought along a pair of the pests together.
The ensuing scuffle, whilst chaotic, passed without any major injuries.
It wasn't the only time the usual slaughter was interrupted like this,
and eventually I, too, stumbled upon such a duo.
Seeing them huddled together in a tree, I withdrew as quietly as I could manage,
no matter how slim the chance of them noticing me at our considerable distance.
Giving a wide birth to the danger,
I chose a different path after reporting back.

<!-- TODO: describe the struggle for the feather
> Damn. He's a gonerâ€¦

> He's still alive.

A woman's voice reached my ears, rough as the rocks in Shatter Valley.

> He's about not to be.

> You owe him the pay for the job.

> We don't pay the dead. You know that as well as I do.
> Whaddaya want me to do?

> We can't just leave him here! Take him back to the temple.

> To do what? He can't feed himself, how do you suppose he'll afford treatment?
> Drop it. You know we don't do that kind o' thing,
> just because he reminds you ofâ€¦

I didn't hear the rest, but the last thing I saw, before passing out,
was a burly man dropping to the ground next to me.
