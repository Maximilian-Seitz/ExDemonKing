# A first job

I had been wrong.
I had thought of the appearance of a soul as an expression of one's self image,
but I had to admit that there was more to it.
The sphynx had claimed that humans, too, fed on the souls of their slain foes,
a fact I had little hope of refuting, once I stepped through the tunnel.

Welcoming me was a wave of auras, as soon as I stepped through the door.
I had, of course, seen many an aura, of those who lead others into battle,
those who gave their lives to save others, those who braved grand foes alone,
and, strongest among them, the hero.
Still, they had never been this concentrated.
A champion on the battlefield was one among hundreds,
and two would rarely fight side by side.

I had been wrong in believing their presences
to have come from the situations they had faced.
Battle, after all, demands from us everything we have.
So much so, that most of these idols I had seen had perished shortly after.
How was it then, that these auras were emitted deep within a city?
Was it truly that these slayers of demons had taken in parts of their strength?

As my eyes adjusted to the unforeseen stimulation,
I became able to take in the details of my new surroundings.
The first thing I noticed was the distribution of the auras.
Rather than presenting as a homogenous clump,
strength was focused on some, few, individuals.
Next was the physical.

The room I found myself in was just a few steps into the tunnel,
and looked like it had been carved into the stone.
No door blocked access to establishment,
but I suspected it to be the safest location in the country nonetheless.
Though it may have been the most dangerous for some, myself possibly included.
It's furnishing resembled that of a tavern, and so did it's size.
Only it's height was lacking,
resulting in an oppressive atmosphere, similar to that of a prison.
Light, while dim, was being shed by stones embedded into the walls and ceiling.

The guests were people of various lands,
many showing features found neither here nor in the region I had hailed from.
This wasn't surprising, as adventurers were, in the end, travelers,
not bound to any place, but also not claiming any as their home.
And so it was here that they gathered, drinking away their earnings at this bar,
trying to forget the hardships they had faced, and the friends they had lost.
An adventurer's life was cheap, after all.

The strength displayed by most in this room wasn't much
greater than that of an ordinary person, perhaps even less.
Few took up the profession for the thrill of battle, rather,
they were forced to take up this life, left with no other choice.
Every child knew this.
Every child knew to stay away from those who had nothing to loose.
Those who would risk their lives for the money needed for their next drink.

I was no different from them.
I, too, had nowhere else to turn, and no other way to acquire food.
I, too, had risked my life for a loaf of bread, and a set of clothes.
Many lost that bet. Would I be different?
I laid claim to a goal that drove me, but so did many others here.
Poverty wasn't the only force that lead people here,
but no sense of pride, or desire for revenge,
would stop the bleeding from a goblin's knife.

I stepped towards the local who stood behind the bar,
having lost the sense of disassociation, I had had in the market.
These were outcasts, so how could I not belong?
The man who's age I couldn't gage,
was engaged in conversation before he noticed my approach, and turned to me.
Beneath his bold head, and smooth skin, lay the soul of a warrior,
not shining golden, like Fate's, but imitating cold, hard steel.
His clothes were, unlike those of the other inhabitants of this city,
quite similar to mine.

> Greetings. I seek employment for an adventurer. Can you help me?

> Rightâ€¦ What's your timetable?

Seemingly sensing my trouble answering, he spoke again.

> How fast do you need the coin?

> My rations have almost run dry. It is rather urgent.

> Ever killed anything before?

> I've slain goblins and slimes.

I felt his analytical look quickly scan me, before he looked through the room,
slightly raised his head, and shouted towards someone.

> Roy, still need another body?

The answer came not verbally, but in the form of a burly man
pushing through some people next to me.
His familiar looking middle aged face was covered in thick stubbles
and accompanied by short black hair.
Clad in leather armor, and adorned with a sword by his hip,
he looked ready for a fight, but his spirit suggested a much harsher reality.
Red. That would be his color, if I had to ascribe one to him.

He didn't radiate his strength in any way,
but it was demonstrated by the details his self-image produced.
An image that mimicked his physical appearance fairly accurately,
only differing in one important way. Blood covered his body.
Much of it clung to him, as if he had just slaughtered a pig,
while other places showed clear scrapes and gashes.
He looked like a last survivor standing on a battlefield.

> 'Bout to head out, but sure.

> You know the details?

Quickly having picked me out as the offered candidate, he addressed me.

> No.

> Well, we go 'round the city, clearing out all the treelins we can find.
> We get a commission for every one we kill.
> Since you don't look like you can fight, you're gonna have to scout.
> It's dangerous, but everyone gets the same pay,
> so you're gonna have to make yourself useful.

> You'll get a sword and some arm-pads lent, even as a scout,
> but you can be a fighter if you want to.
> Not that I'd recommend it, if you can't swing a sword.

If every participant received the same portion of pay,
I expected to receive enough compensation to feed me, at least.
In addition to that, scouting likely fit my abilities.
All in all, it was within the realm of what I had expected.
It seemed acceptable for my first contract.

> Scouting would be acceptable, though I've not heard of treelins before.

> Just think of a furry fuckin' goblin jumpin' through trees.

The thought gave me shivers, but I doubted much easier work was to be found,
so I gave a nod in response to his description.

> All right. Come on.

Waving his hand to follow him, Roy returned through the gap he came by.
Passing some patrons, we arrived at a table surrounded by about ten people,
including my guide.
The group was using the space to prepare for combat, putting on boots,
helping each other don some pieces of armor or inspecting their weapons.
Most of them seemed to be of average strength,
if my assumption about the appearances of souls was correct.

An open chest stood to one side of the table, almost reaching it in height.
Various pieces of equipment were strewn inside,
ranging from weapons and armor to shields and cloaks.
When I arrived, Roy lay his hand on the brim of the chest,
as if to point it out.

> Grab some arm guards and a sword from here, and put 'em on.
> If you need help, ask someone here.
> We're gonna head out when everyone's ready.
