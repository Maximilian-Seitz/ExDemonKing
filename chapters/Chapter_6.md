# A first job

I had been wrong.
I had thought of the appearance of a soul as an expression of one's self image,
but I had to admit that there was more to it.
The sphynx had claimed that humans, too, fed on the souls of their slain foes,
a fact I had little hope of refuting, once I stepped through the tunnel.

Welcoming me was a wave of auras, as soon as I stepped through the door.
I had, of course, seen many an aura, of those who lead others into battle,
those who gave their lives to save others, those who braved grand foes alone,
and, strongest among them, the hero.
Still, they had never been this concentrated.
A champion on the battlefield was one among hundreds,
and two would rarely fight side by side.

I had been wrong in believing their presences
to have come from the situations they had faced.
Battle, after all, demands from us everything we have.
So much so, that most of these idols I had seen had perished shortly after.
How was it then, that these auras were emitted deep within a city?
Was it truly that these slayers of demons had taken in parts of their strength?

As my eyes adjusted to the unforeseen stimulation,
I became able to take in the details of my new surroundings.
The first thing I noticed was the distribution of the auras.
Rather than presenting as a homogenous clump,
strength was focused on some, few, individuals.
Next was the physical.
