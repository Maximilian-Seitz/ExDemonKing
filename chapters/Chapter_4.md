# An old acquaintance

> You came.

The soft voice resounded throughout the cave,
unperturbed by my struggle to recover my breath.
Laying on my back, I turned my head towards the source.
Her elegant body resembled that of a cat, but rivaled the size of a horse.
Wings, sprouting from her sides, were covered in feathers like a bird's,
and her human head impressed the dignity of a queen onto any who saw it.
The *immortal* sphinx.

Observing me, with a look I could only describe as condescending, she lay there.
The aura of her soul, colorless in others, manifested as blinding golden,
furthering the majesty of her presence.
My skin crawled from the gaudy appearance she had created for herself,
bright enough to have served as a beacon which had saved my life.

> Yes… Your protégé has failed.

> Yes. Do you resent him for it?

> No. It would be like resenting a fawn for failing to slay a wolf…
> or rather the very lightning raining down from the sky.

> The attempt was what worried me.

> I am thankful for the distraction he created.
> It is you I resent.

> I am well aware of that. Hearing you say it hurts nonetheless.

It was a pointless exchange. Pleasantries, at best.

> Still, I am glad to see you. You look well.

> You look the same.

> My body withers away as we speak.
> Don't put too much trust into that trick you've learned.

> I don't need magic to recognize you for the demon you are.

> What a reductionist view. To the point of being useless.
> I suppose that, too, is something you will have to learn.

> We digress. You came here, meaning you need my help.

Bluntly cutting off our banter, she seemed ready to negotiate.
With her front legs crossed, she leaned slightly in my direction.
Her minimal movements hinted at the state of her body,
but I still recoiled, standing up from my sitting position.
Dripping wet cloth clung to my limbs, leaving me in shivers.
I braced myself before putting forth my demand.

> I do. Make me a hero.

> What for? Revenge? It is certainly no sense of duty that drives you.

> What difference does it make?
> I would become your pawn, yet you refuse me?

> A pawn has yet to turn into a queen, does she not?
> You misunderstand the nature of what I can provide.
> It is not power, but a duty I bestow.

> Then it's that duty I am willing to accept.

> You may be willing, but you are unfit.

Anger rose within me. Her flat out refusal had no sense to it.
With none to choose from, how could she reject the one who had come to her.
Was her intent to wait for another to find her?
Did she know someone would come?

> Think. To what end would you wield the holy sword?
> You've experienced it yourself,
> the futility of it's power without the right wielder.

> I can learn.

> Have you not spent the last decade learning?
> I can see it in your eyes, even now you use the knowledge you have stolen.

> The knowledge you deemed worthless when last we met?
> You would have me use that as my only weapon?

I regretted coming. Her unwavering passivity remained,
no less undying than she herself.

> Truth changes according to the circumstances.
> Knowledge, just like a sword, requires the right user.
> Without you, it was worthless.
> But it isn't the only weapon I suggest you use.
> You'll need allies.
> Without them, you'll only repeat that poor child's mistake.

> Allies… Is that what you call them?
> I refuse to utilize others, like you,
> casting their lives into my battle.

> It will become theirs in time, weather you involve them or not.

> So there is nothing you will offer.

I sat back down.
The journey had exhausted me, and this conversation possibly more so.
I started placing my belongings next to me to let them dry.
Feeling the moist bread robbed me of the last remains of my spirit.
I lay down, ready to sleep, doing my best to ignore my observer.

> You seem agitated. Let us finish our conversation once you've rested.

Neither the years without sleep,
nor the hard floor kept me from dozing off for long.
The dreamless night progressed without interruption,
leaving me to make up for the accumulated exhaustion.
The cold finally ended my rest.
Shivering from the still soaked pants, and lack of shirt, I awakened.

> How long has it been?

> Not long enough.

> It'll have to be.

> Try not to be too harsh with yourself. It will break you one day.

Her eyes shifted away from me for the first time,
looking where I had placed what I owned.

> What is it you intend to do now? Your equipment is lacking
> and your training nonexistent.

She turned her attention back to me.
What sounded like an accusation was a mere statement of fact.
The only things I had learned were out of my reach,
making her proposal to arm myself with that knowledge laughable.

> Worst of all, though, is your soul, malnourished even for human standards.

My shivers worsened, imagining her implications.

> A true demon's words.

> A natural suggestion. Did you think humans innocent of this?
> Ignorant, perhaps, like cubs, blind to the plight of their victims.
> But not different.
> Only in so far that humans cannot sense the process directly.

What little bread I had eaten fought with my throat as I
thought back to the goblin I had slain.
I had clung to the slim façade of doubt I had maintained about the event,
but it was torn down without resistance, forcing me to confront my hesitation.
There was no other choice, I knew that, but I would need time to brace myself,
before committing such horrors again in the future.

> So you say…
> But to answer your question, I will flee.
> Traversing the remainder of the Shattered Mountains.
> There, I intended to train, but you refused me the weapon I need,
> rendering this meaningless.

I hadn't formed plans beyond that. There was no point.
What else was there to do but gather strength?

> A reasonable plan,
> but your lack of interaction with others of your kind makes it lacking.
> I will repeat once again, that you have all you need.
> Become an adventurer, that way you may discover this for yourself.

> An adventurer… Fine. It'll reduce inquiries about myself, I suppose.

> I'm glad. I was able to be of help, in the end.

She giggled.
It was an action I hadn't expected to see from her, but there it was.
Still, it was a fleeting moment,
quickly fading to allow for sorrow to fill her eyes.

> I was happy to see you again, but now we must part.
> You've asked for my help, and I will give you what I can…
> Even if it breaks my heart to do so.

She paused, then extended one of her wings.
The small movement alone must have taken much of her strength,
taking into account her bonds.

> There are only few ways to protect a soul, once it is freed.
> Fewer yet for the soul of another, none within my current grasp.

At the very tip of her wing, a feather began to glow.
Not from her soul, but of her body.
The incandescence revealed parts of her true body for the first time.
Most feathers were missing from her leathery appendage,
while rashes and cysts covered the skin that was exposed.
The dissonance between the soul and body made it appear as if
the latter was encased in the former, like a slime, gnawing away at the flesh.

> But there is a way to prevent manipulation of it. By anyone.
> A way which will even stop the very gods
> from inviting that soul into the afterlife.
> Destruction.

> My gift lacks far behind the holy sword, but attach it to a body,
> and upon death it will destroy at least a human's soul.

> You've reconsidered?

> If it is your wish… It is the only protection I can offer.

> Thank you. Truly.

> I hope to never see you use it.

With those words, the face I had just seen vanished.
It was the death of the immortal sphinx. The death of Fate.
