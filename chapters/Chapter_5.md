# New lands

Unlike the soul of a slime or a goblin, hers vanished in an instant.
The light of the feather was the only one left behind,
showing her body crumbling into dust, before drifting to the ground.

Had she been waiting for me?
Holding out for years for my return, before finally giving in to the corrosion.
Or had she been waiting for her chosen to return,
deciding to support me instead, when I came in his place?
I soon gave up on answering these questions,
acknowledging her motivations to be forever beyond my grasp.

Instead of aiming for the unreachable,
I approached the feather I had been bestowed.
Hot. It emanated heat befitting of the unwavering light radiating from it,
forcing me to withdraw my hand.
Forced to produce a handle,
I picked up some of the wet cloth laying on the floor
to wrapped around the feather's tip.

Looking at my new treasure, I hoped for it to cool eventually.
Pushing it into my flesh appeared painful in any case,
making the scorching heat an unwelcome addition.
Still, I had stumbled through the darkness enough to appreciate the light.
Faint as it was, in the absence of any other,
it would allow for some navigation through the labyrinth.

I started moving before my magical torch had any chance to fade,
only pausing to collect my remaining belongings.
Nothing was left behind, including my cloak.
Useless as it was, I wasn't keen on having it clearly mark my visit.

The space I had slept in held only the sphinx's magical prison,
a hole in the ground, and a single path into the wall.
The hole led back into the underwater caves I had come through,
leaving only the path as an option to escape.
I didn't remember the exact layout of the vast structure I found myself in,
but knew that I had to move up. Back above ground.

Traversing both narrow passages and large cavities,
I lost every sense of direction,
leaving me guessing at every turn, where to head next.
I didn't feel lost, however, as my altitude consistently increased,
even beyond the surface of the valley.
As the climb continued, for what I believed to be a good part of the morning,
I had some moist bread as breakfast.
My journey lasted a while longer,
before I finally saw another light reflect off the walls.

What I found was a section of tunnel simply ending,
but blocked from leading directly into the valley,
by a gargantuan slab of stone.
It's scale suggested it to have been a section of the mountains
which had separated.
There wasn't a perfect seal between the exit and the blockade,
allowing some rays of light to pass, and, more importantly,
leaving a gap for me to fit through.
Not only the walls, but also ground and ceiling stopped where I stood,
leaving what would have been a sheer cliff, if not for that blockade.
My goal was down.

I recoiled at the thought of what I had to do,
but it was ether this, or continuing to the top of the mountain.
A mountaintop crawling with demons.
My choices were, as was becoming a trend, all deadly.

Sighing, I leaned forward, bracing myself against this wall.
Only the pressure I exerted upon the stone kept me suspended,
allowing for my descent into the gap.
The climb was terrifying.
Nothing below me would catch, or even slow my fall, were I to slip.
It wasn't a straight fall, but not something I would leave uninjured.

Small slips made my heart drop every few meters,
but the approaching ground gave me more confidence.
A shudder of relief crawled over my skin, as I made contact.
I found myself in an awkward position between two walls,
having to shuffle sideways to escape.
Awkward, but not dangerous. A trade I was more than happy to make.

The sunshine kissing my cold limbs served as a pleasant reward for my efforts,
as I stepped into the valley proper again.
I spent a moment to take in the warmth, and my new surroundings.
While still the same valley,
the view had changed considerably from the half I had traversed.
Grey walls were now tinted in a green hue,
seemingly stemming from a species of slimy moss, which had taken root here.
I appreciated the break in the monotony.

Not only the walls, but also the ground was different.
What had been stone covered in pebbles and rocks, was compressed dirt,
with bits of grass surviving from the little that reached here.
I contemplated the reason for the change,
while I took some steps in the direction I believed to
lead me out of the valley.

A path, though empty, was present here as well.
The grooves in the dirt brought me past occasional shrubbery and trees.
These trees differed from the ones I was knew, and had traveled past before.
I wasn't able to quantify the exact nature of the difference,
but they certainly grew in a much more chaotic manner,
as if to look for the sunlight, so scarce where they sprouted.

Further up, above me, I saw greenery hanging from the tops of the mountains.
The curtains of vines hung as if to explore the depths below them,
but didn't reach anywhere near the ground.
Creatures, in these parts, were much more vibrant than in the stone desert,
making their homes within the plants found here.
I focused on my sight, spying even the small birds and critters
native to my surroundings.

The sun, which had welcomed me when I had entered the valley,
soon hid behind the mountains.
It didn't leave the valley entirely without light,
but a shadow descended upon the landscape, stealing the warmth from the air.
My clothes had mostly dried from the little exposure they had received,
but I still mourned the loss of this bringer of life.

For a while, the creatures above were my only distraction, as I traveled alone.
Eventually, however, I encountered others, just like I had expected.
Merchants passed me by, on the road their wagons had carved.
These wagons, while mostly plain,
were sometimes decorated with signs or colorful cloth covers.
I expected these to carry fine wares, sold to nobles,
not only based on their appearances,
but also on the guards they were accompanied by.

Guards.
Most of them were likely adventurers, hired for the journey through this area.
That was my assumption, though I knew fairly little about the
employment processes of adventurers.
I anticipated experiencing this myself.
Perhaps I would find myself among their ranks soon enough,
joining some of those I encountered here as one of their own.
It felt odd.

I wasn't averse to becoming an adventurer,
it just felt unreal to have a path set out for myself.
It having been a suggestion by the sphynx made me somewhat uncomfortable,
but I couldn't deny the sense of purpose it gave me.
Having had my sights set on a vague distant goal, I had felt lost.

Most of the guard I met spared me little attention,
and others lost interest when they noticed the rusty dagger in my belt.
I appreciated the privacy they afforded me.
Apart from wagons, I encountered no others.
Neither horseback riders nor travelers by foot crossed my path,
likely due to the length of the journey
the mountains force upon any who would traverse them.

By the time evening came, I was exhausted to the core.
My previous attempt at sleep had been cut short,
and I lacked the physical endurance of a soldier,
who could push through the night.
Thus, I was forced to settle down.
The multitude of crevices within the walls allowed me
to find one in which to take refuge for my rest.

Bunching up some grass from the area, I created a bed for myself,
planning to spend my first money on a bedroll.
I quickly changed my mind, however, as I retrieved my remaining bread.
No river passed this half of the valley,
but staying vigilant had rewarded me with the occasional stream from the rocks.
These were enough to quench my thirst,
so the waterlogged loaf I held had no appeal beyond the nourishment it provided.

The night passed quietly, apart from some bugs which had infiltrated my bed.
Though perhaps it had been me who had stolen their home.
My journey continued just like it had ended the day before,
but the decrease in size of the mountains became apparent.
What made it most notable was the length the sun was present throughout the day.
I made sure to cherish every moment of it,
hoping to leave the mountains behind the next time it passed by.

My hope was betrayed by reality for another two days,
which I spent single-mindedly wandering the single available path.
Then, by the end of the third day, the cliffs flanking me
gave way to slopes of mountains, which grew more distant.
At first, they prevented escape, just like the walls had,
but eventually paths lead off into these mountains.
Considering my depleting food, I stayed on the most prominent path,
hoping it would lead to civilization soonest.

As the mountains receded, trees took their place.
Their density wouldn't allow passage, as their numbers grew,
and they intertwined into a complex web of bark and leaves.
The road I followed became more and more enveloped by this jungle around it.
What surprised me most though, were the flowers that persisted
in this deep forest, unperturbed by the lush ceiling of leaves above them.
Be it purple or blue, flowers big enough to
seat small birds peaked through the covered floor.

My sight lingered on a bird standing still in the middle of the air.
These birds were the obviously visible ones around me,
but far from the only inhabitants of the forest.
Between snakes climbing trees and insects covering every surface,
I lost any desire to more closely inspect the flowers next to me.
Those without the insight I possessed would undoubtedly find
the view beautiful. I, on the other hand, found it frightening.

I thought back to the slimes, and my sight wandered to the natural ceiling.
My attention stayed focused on it from then on,
out of fear of any descending animals.
It was likely an irrational fear,
but my neck crawled every time I lowered my vision.
The only times I allowed myself to be distracted were when
the scenery around me changed.
I passed rivers, clearings with small lakes, and even small waterfalls,
some of which were far behind the trees,
while others directly bordered the path.

The elevation, which remained fairly constant throughout the valley
became more variable, furthering my exhaustion.
Not only the height, but also the direction varied much more now,
as the road avoided rocks and trees impeding it's progress.
The sun, which I had so hoped to see,
sometimes found gaps in the leaves, through which it shone.
As I kept my eyes up, I eventually saw
a distant plateau rising above the jungle.

Rocks with intricate shapes adorned it's top.
I would have mistaken them for art, if they hadn't been bustling with life.
This wasn't art, it was a city,
barely visible from where I stood, but undeniably grand.
Now I knew I was on the right track. Into the unknown, where no one knew me.
It came just in time to hopefully spare me having to hunt for my own food,
which had run dry the day before.

Wagons now passed me more frequently than before,
sometimes maneuvering dangerously around corners or over hills.
My worry wasn't shared by these experienced drivers, it seemed,
as they hurried past these sections without pause.
I appreciated the contrast between this, and my previous experience on a wagon,
when I saw the faces of some frightened guards.
I'm sure they, too, would have preferred to have joined the farmer on his ride.

Nearing the city, the ground began to have more tracks,
not only restricted to the road, but also spreading into the woods,
as if claiming them for the people who lived here.
Nature was replaced by muddy ground with various footprints and puddles.
It was there, where I encountered the first citizens.

Seated near a fairly dry area, they used roots as seats
while they were busy processing fruits.
They used jagged knives, produced from a matt black material,
to peel red shells off fruits twice the size of my fist.
My gaze went unnoticed, as they focused on their work,
discarding the pieces of waste in the dirt beneath them.

From then on, I saw many such groups, marking the start of the city outskirts.
Some worked on similar fruits, while others carved away at wood
or worked with other parts of plants.
I found the ones particularly peculiar who beat away at leaves,
bigger than my torso, using stones.
As I observed these workers,
I strove to memorize the various resources they utilized in their tasks,
and the yield they each produced through their labor.

The knowledge of what had value, and what could be discarded,
could become a valuable tool for me, who had so very little.
Neither apples nor cherries grew in these parts,
but I now knew of at least one fruit that would keep me from starving,
if I had nothing else to fall back to.
Two other details stuck out, other than the work being done.
One was the tools they used having been mostly made of that same black material,
which I hadn't seen before, and the other concerned the people themselves.
They looked odd.

Or rather, it was me who looked odd, as it was their land I had entered.
At first I hadn't noticed, having been focused on their souls,
rather than their physical appearances.
Once I did notice however, these differences were striking.
Their skins had an unusually brown tint, and their clothing was scant,
focusing mainly on their most indecent body parts.
The clothes they wore weren't less well made than the ones I wore,
simply differed in design.

Further into what I presumed to be a city, vegetation became more sparse,
allowing for many paths between the trees that remained.
These winding paths created an atmosphere of a plaza,
which was emphasized by the many stalls that had been set up,
and the bustle of the many people here.
Large sections of fabric hung between trees,
creating covers under which people set up wares they traded
or offered their services.

I would have been doubtful about an organization for adventurers in these parts,
if not for the recommendation of the sphinx.
Looking around, I saw various traders, selling fruits, cloth, and the like,
or those offering services, like barbers.
People haggled and shouted around me, praising the quality of their wares.
It was chaos. And, more importantly, I failed to understand any of it.

The words being spoken were all foreign to me,
even if I had a basic grasp of the contents, from the context.
I knew this would happen, but had no way to circumvent it. At least for now.
The only thing I could do was to find those who could
overcome this language barrier for me.
My first idea for where to look for such,
was the place where the traveling merchants gathered.

I hadn't strayed far from the central path which had
started as my trail from Shatter Valley.
On it, mules were being led, carrying bags of goods,
and carts and wagons also stuck to it.
It was still only made of dirt,
but trees had been cleared in a fairly straight line there,
and people seemingly respected the separation of modes of travel.
I was confident that it would lead to a suited location for these merchants,
where they could unload their wares and stable their horses.

Making sure not to lose sight of this route,
I made my way through the various traders around me.
It wasn't long before I wished I had money. And a way to communicate.
Skins, meats and leathers of animals unknown to me,
tools like the ones I had seen the laborers use,
and even living animals and plants were all sold here.

Most of it seemed to serve the day to day lives of the ones living here,
and the wares showed qualities befitting of this.
Cloths weren't colored, nor were colors produced here at all,
meals prepared there went mostly unflavored,
and the livestock wasn't beautiful like horses nobles would buy,
but seemed geared to work.
It made me realize that this, while exotic for me,
was a part of the daily lives of the people around me.

I felt left out. Or at least like I didn't belong with the people here,
not becoming part of the crowd, but being surrounded by it.
The odd looks I received every now and then
became more irritating once I realized this.
My enthusiasm for possible the trades I imagined myself having faded.
I stopped mingling from then on.

Having kept my eyes down, it had been long into view before I noticed it.
The plateau.
It had been covered by the trees, but now it's majesty was mostly revealed.
As far as was possible from the ground, at least.
I expected only a bird to have ever seen the true form of the city,
unhindered by trees, hills or rocks.
What I saw looked like jagged rocks at first sight, but covered with people.
On closer inspection it became clear that these were stairs.
Stairs as wide as the city, domesticating this natural rock formation.
They were interrupted by natural stone in some sections,
creating walls or platforms,
but the masses moving up and down filled most of the space.

Above the stairs towered many man-made structures.
I was hesitant to call them buildings,
as they reminded me more of a military complex,
with robust stone seemingly capable of
withstanding most attacks levied against it.
The only clue as to the opposite was the lack of a cohesive wall,
allowing those willing to scale the stairs free entry.

Barely any portion of these rocks had remained untouched by human hands.
The buildings on top appeared to have been constructed from the
materials gathered from the stone beneath them,
raising an entire city from the ground.
I had heard of, and seen, many conquests of men in the past.
Castles destroyed and cities burnt, all of them aiming at their fellow humans,
but none compared to this conquest against nature itself.

My infatuation with the stone city was only broken once I tripped on a root,
almost tumbling into another pedestrian.
The base of the stairs had come into view since I had been captivated,
and there I saw openings, worked into the wall.
Beneath some platforms entrances were carved,
leading to caves, frequented by passer-byes.
I counted at least half a dozen levels of such entrances on the stairs,
making them a major traffic route, even compared to the market I was leaving.

Some of the biggest of these holes were located at the very base.
I found what I was looking for among these.
Sheltered by cloth, suspended between poles, stood horses,
lined up next to each other, tied to sticks in the ground.
Leaves were piled before them as food,
leading me to speculate weather these leaves were edible by humans.
After remembering that horses ate grass, I gave up on the idea,
and started looking for someone associated with these animals instead.

The only one who appeared responsible for the horses was a woman
employing a sort of paddle to rotate the leaves.
She looked native, suggested by her tan skin,
and wore pants that reached just below her knees.
Her chest was wrapped in fabric, leaving her stomach and shoulders both exposed.
I couldn't know if she could help me until I tried, so I approached her,
getting her attention even through the crowd.

> Greetings.

> Hello. Have you been sent in search for a stable?

The intonation of her speech was partially off, and she spoke with long breaths,
as if connecting the sentence into a single word.
Still, I hadn't expected to be greeted this articulately
by what was essentially a farmhand.
In my experience even writing was a skill
not taught to many in these professions,
let alone the ability to converse with those from another land.

> No, it's employment for adventurers I seek.

> Ah… They gather there.

She pointed towards an opening above and to the right
of the one this stable seemed to belong to.

> Thank you for your help.

> Good luck…

Leaving me with a concerned smile, she returned to her work.
I, on the other hand, walked towards the ground below the location
this kind woman pointed out.
A more direct route would had been possible,
but I felt uncomfortable at the thought of having to cut
through the crowd diagonally on an incline.
The movement was chaotic enough as it was,
making me hesitant to disturb it further.
Uneven steps, worked into the rough material, delivered me through the people.
The tunnel, as wide as an arm span, lead into a pillar,
towards what I hoped to make into my new life.
