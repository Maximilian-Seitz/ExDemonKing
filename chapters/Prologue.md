# Prologue

So there he stood, holy sword in hand,
burning hatred in his eyes, and a clear intent to kill me.

The hero.

I didn't remember his name.
I didn't expect him to survive this encounter after all.

> So we finally meet!

No, I was almost certain that he wouldn't.
I suppose I pitied him, but by then my hands
had been drenched in the blood of many.
A single person's name wasn't something I could care about,
even if it was the hero deemed capable of killing me.

> Well, you finally found me out.
> It seemed only fair to make an appearance,
> after all the trouble you went through, to expose me.

I could feel a mocking smile creep across my lips,
while my arms stretched almost as if to invite the hero to attack.
No weapon could be found in my hands, but rather than a lack of them,
there was simply no need.

Everyone knew this.

This doubt wasn't enough to stop the hero though.
Spurred on by his determination he started his charge.
My body didn't move.
His sword aimed at the center of my chest as he gained momentum.
My body didn't move.
Until he finally reached me,
his sword piercing through my skin, into my flesh, reaching my heart.
My body still didn't move.
The trembling hero raised his head.
Our eyes met.
He had known this to be a trap, yet his sword hit it's mark.
The smile on my face grew,
as my head tilted to look down at the wide eyes before me.

Nothing had happened yet. Still, he knew. He had made a mistake.
With unparalleled speed he leapt back, pulling his sword from my gaping wound.
It was then that I first moved.

I fell.

My vision moved up towards the sky, and I knew it was over.
The pain in throughout my body was immeasurable.
No matter how many times I had gone through hardships,
my heart was destroyed. That wasn't something I could endure.
Disregarding my suffering, something grew in my chest.
Before I even hit the ground,
the gaping wound in my chest exploded with purple fog.

Even through the agony, I stared at the fog.
Even as I hit the dirt and rocks, I stared at the fog.
I stared at the fog until it had left my body entirely,
vanishing towards the hero.

I was still alive.

I had predicted all of this, except that I would be alive.
This didn't mean I was capable of running away,
but it meant there was a glimmer of hope to grasp onto.
Through sheer tenacity I grasped.

And my hand responded.

In the first time in 10 years, my hand responded.
It was weak, but this was enough for me.
I moved my arm towards my belt.
It was impossible for me to see what I was doing,
since I couldn't even raise my head,
but I found what I was looking for.
A single vial.

I moved the vial towards my mouth
and, with the last of my strength, bit down on it.
The glass shattered, and the mixture spilled into my throat.
I swallowed, glass and all. It didn't matter.
After all, this was elixir.

The pain didn't fade. Not at first.
I couldn't tell how long it took, as I laid there, paralyzed.
The last bits of my energy had been used up.
I could only wait,
even as every muscle in my body wanted to contort in anguish.
Color faded from my vision, and only ringing remained in my ears.

This silence continued until it was interrupted by a jolt.
And another. My heart had beat. After this, my senses started to return,
and with them my movement. My movement. Mine.

I could hardly believe it, but this wasn't the time to celebrate.
Raising my head, I glanced at the hero before me.
There, he kneeled. Barely keeping his body from falling over,
as spasms shot through him periodically.
The fog was nowhere to be seen, but I knew what had happened.
It was evident that the hero was in no condition to fight.
Nether was I. Not that I had intended to.
My mind only focused on one thing. Escape. Before it was too late.

So I pushed myself off the ground.
With my hands slipping off the moist dirt, a few attempts were necessary.
These movements weren't natural to me, after so long.
I pushed myself backwards, away from the struggle in front of me,
then turned around.
With some stumbles I managed to gain footing.
I didn't look back. Not once.

The area around me was already known to me, and I ran as fast as I could.
Smeared with blood and dirt, my clothes hung from my chest like rags.
Like this I rushed between the trees,
leaving the clearing of our encounter behind me.
