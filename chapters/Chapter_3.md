# Setting off

A new day had dawned, loudly announced by a local rooster.
It was that signal which brought the farm to life.
The cattle became active, chickens made themselves known,
and even Ben awoke.
The fire had gone out a while ago, but it had fulfilled it's purpose.
What remained of the goblin was only a charred lump,
and a dagger it had used as a sword.
Rust had encroached on the blade I now held.

> Mornin'! How'd the night go for ya, boys?

Greg approached, holding an empty bucket in one,
and a small stool in the other hand.
I pointed at the ashes, in response to the question.

> I'll be… Good job.
> How 'bout the two o' you get washed up, and go inside.
> A good time calls for good food, I'd say.

> Oh, and tell my wife. She'll get you the clothes I promised.

Without waiting for a response, he went on towards the barn's door.
I was still hesitant to clean myself,
shedding this layer which protected my identity,
but I knew that this wasn't a permanent solution.
Being dressed like a commoner had to suffice,
and I trusted it would. At least for a while.
I planned to have left these lands by the time
the word of my appearance's change had spread.

Ben, who looked to be half asleep, wandered towards the river.
His many words were nowhere to be found in this state.
My destination lay opposite his. The house.
Clothes I had fought for were waiting,
and I was glad to be rid of the rags still hanging off my chest.

The door to the building was wide ajar, inviting light into the interior.
Inside the single room stood a small table, bed,
and a cooking place with a chair.
There, a woman sat, stoking the fire beneath some pots.
Her awkward posture while sitting made the action seem cumbersome.
Not wanting to interrupt her, I stopped at the entrance.

> Oh, welcome. You must be the boy my husband invited.
> Ah…

A surprised shout escaped her, after she turned her head in my direction.

> Are you hurt? You look terrible!

> I'm not. Thank you for your concern.

> Don't just brush it off. If you're hurt, you'll have to clean yourself up.
> And take that rag off, it'll only make things worse.

> I'm really not hurt.

> There's no point arguing, is there? There's clothes under the bed.
> They're all the same, so just take a set. And then wash up.

> Oh, and tell Ben to hurry back, I'll need his help.

It seemed she had already grasped the situation.
Ben's comment about the couple's communication came to mind,
but I suspected she had simply overheard our conversation.
Discarding the thought of her reading minds,
I gathered what I came here for.
The woman returned to her duties, as I did so.
She only raised her head towards me again, once I left.

> Don't forget about Ben. There won't be food without him.

> I won't.

At the river, I found the person in question wiping his face.
I did as I was told, which invoked only unintelligible mumbling in response.

Disrobing myself, I considered each piece of clothing I had worn.
First, the cloak. It had no practical purpose I could discern,
and would merely serve to identify me.
The remains of the shirt had fewer uses yet.
I chose to dispose of both items, but wanted to do so thoroughly.
The belt, pants and boots were last.
With no other options for belt and boots, I had to wear them.
Not so for the extravagant trousers fit for a king.
They comprised the entirety of the fortune I held.

Having laid out these items, I stepped into the flow.
Cold water eroded dried dirt off my limbs,
while engulfing me in an almost pleasant pain.
Thoughts that had captivated me throughout the night
were forced from my mind in an instant.
Giving in to the meditative experience,
I enjoyed the calm as long as I bear the cold.

The return to reality felt harsh.
Shivering, I picked up my new linen clothes of a simple design.
They were perfect, leaving only my boots and belt exposed.
I had left these unwashed for them to blend in.
Satisfied with my new attire, I was ready.
Ready for my journey.

Though I wanted to wander off right away, there was something left to do.
A pleasant breeze accompanied me on my way back,
waving the grass on the hills around the farm.
Within it's bounds cows and chickens had been freed,
wandering the grounds in search for the ideal feed.
Back at the house the open door welcomed me, along with a sweet smell.
Sizzling could be heard from the fireplace.
Inside were the three people I had expected.
Ben and Greg sat at the table,
while the latter's wife hadn't relocated since my last visit.

> Ain't you a whole 'nother person.

> Oh, yea.

Between the two men who commended my appearance,
stood a plate with flat pieces of cooked dough stacked on top.

> You're just in time. Last one's just about done.
> Greg!

> I heard ya.

Being called, the man went up to his wife and lifted her along with her chair.
Heaving a sigh, he spun around, setting her down at the table.
The unexpected spectacle left me stunned,
while everyone else in the room seemed unaffected.
Electing to emulate their apathy towards the action,
I found a remaining stool for myself.

> Now, let's eat!
> We're having pancakes today. Scraped together some sugar, so enjoy.

So the cook of the feast instructed.

> Oh, I never introduced myself! And knowing my husband, nether did he.
> Name's Margret.

> I'm Martin. Thank you for the meal.

> Eat, before it's all gone.

Her worry was not unfounded.
By the time our short exchange ended, both men had devoured a pancake each,
rolling them up, and eating them length wise.
I was glad for the example, since the lack of cutlery caused me some confusion.
The race, now including Margret, had few gaps for me to join.
Still feeling satiated, I had no need,
but curiosity about the taste animated my arm.

In the end, I managed to secure two portions for myself.
The process left my fingers covered with a film of oil,
but the taste more than compensated for that discomfort.
Not a word had been spoken during the meal,
which had rendered the house into a battlefield.

> That was great! So, Martin, whadda ya reckon you'll do now?

> I plan to visit Shatter Valley.

> That's a trip and a half.
> I'll be head'n to town today, if ya wanna tag along that far.

> I would appreciate you taking me along. I'm rather lost.

> Great! I'll gear up the horse right away.

Slapping his thighs, Greg stood up and left.
Never having handled a horse before,
I anticipated my presence there to be a hindrance.
Additionally, I had my task.

> Ben.

> Yea?

> Take this.

> What?

I handed my comrade what I had prepared.

> These are fit to be a nobleman's. They were mine.
> I can't keep them, because people are looking for me,
> but with the right buyer they should yield enough
> to buy a farm of this size with.
> They're made from the hide of a hydra,
> and should withstand any test of durability a buyer could undertake.

I had decided to not withhold any crucial details.
For a while, Ben sat in silence, observing the leather in his hands.
Then, his eyes met mine.

> They'll kill me, if I try to sell this.

> Then say you scavenged it off of a cadaver in the forest.
> Those who want to find me want me dead.
> It would be a favor to me.

> Or tell the truth. It will come out eventually.

His stare lingered for a while longer,
ended by his putting the garment away.

> That… explains a lot.

With that the time for my departure had come.
I rose from my seat, nodding to the two I had just shared a meal with.

> Farewell. It was a pleasure to have become acquainted with you.

> Yea, stay safe.

The parting words emanated a sense of finality.
Margret stayed silent, just as she had during my conversation with Ben.
She did, however give me an odd smile, as a goodbye.

In the yard, a horse was being strapped into gear to pull a small wagon.
It must have been stabled with the cows during the night.
Calling the board with wooden wheels a wagon may have been charitable,
but it still provided a considerable improvement to walking.
Various wares were intricately stacked onto the platform,
held there with some pieces of rope.
Years of experience must have molded the farmer's ability,
to have erected them in this manner in the time I took to say my goodbyes.

> Hop on the back. Whole thing's gonna break, if we mess 'round.

After leading the horse through the gate, Greg seated himself behind the horse.
Hills entered my vision as we passed them,
while the farm grew smaller in the distance.
Grooves and rocks in the compressed dirt shook our journey.
On our side the forest I had escaped accompanied our path,
sometimes closer, sometimes barely visible.
Hills slowly extended. Valleys between them disappeared,
connecting them into what could be called mountains.
Grass disappeared from the slopes,
being replaced by rocks as their pitch increased.

> We're on the track to the Valley. There's the mountain, right there.
> Don't mean we're close, just that it's mighty big.
> If ya just go where it's goin', yer bound ta get there.

The voice broke the monotony of clacking echoing over the road.
It had been the only interruption since the start of the journey,
and remained so for a long time.
Time which I had no intention of wasting,
immersing myself, once more, in what I had failed to do at night.
The shaking added a layer of difficulty to the casting,
but the hours of practice had made
the partial construction a routine procedure to me.
Restraining my expectations I went to add the requirements
for permanency to my creation.
Success.

Taking only a single try, my experiment yielded a great result.
Not only was the spell stable, but some surplus flow of mana remained yet.
Invoking more magical phenomena wouldn't be possible with what little was left,
but it punctuated the rise in my capabilities.
Still, my excitement was stifled. My prediction had been correct.
This ability hadn't come to me from nowhere.
No, it had been consumed.
Discomfort swelled within me, as I thought back to the goblin's soul,
but it was undeniable that the stream of energy I had control over had grown.

> I don't know why you're runnin', but if ya don't wanna be seen,
> you're gonna have to get off. Village ain't far now.

> That's probably for the best then.

I had no business in the village.
Hiring a carriage required funds I lacked,
and nothing else of value to me could be gained there.
Greg brought the wagon to a stop, allowing me to safely dismount.

> You know someone who's gonna help ya at the valley?

> That is my hope.

> Gods be with ya, kid.

> I appreciate your worry, but I haven't been a child for a long time now.

> Ain't that what kids always say?

Staying firm in his statement, Greg opened a crate behind him,
taking out a small cloth sack.

> Oh, and since the gods ain't ever fed anyone, take this.
> I hadn't reckoned you'd actually get rid o' the pest,
> so it's just something extra.

> Thank you. Farewell.

His kindness troubled me as he rode off.
I suspected that a day would come,
when he would regret the help he had extended towards me.
The image of his soul overlapping his body stayed in my mind.
It had been the first time I'd seen his soul,
which mostly takes the form of how one sees themselves.
Though based on conjecture, I presumed him to be a deeply honest man.
My attention turned to the bag I had been gifted. It held a loaf of bread.
It frustrated me to have received so much, while having given so little.

I started walking.
Outskirts of the Shattered Mountains awaited me.
Days of travel separated me from them,
yet their magnitude rendered them visible even at this distance.
Mountains growing from both sides guided me,
creating a funnel towards their namesake. Shatter Valley.
I followed not the road, but the gap between the mountains in the distance.
It felt surreal to see a peak at an unfathomable distance
only to pass it hours later,
without having perceived the relative movement at any one time.

Throughout the hours of walking, I came across many a stream
originating in the heights around me.
I took every chance to refill my remaining vials with water.
Creatures passed my way in the distance on occasion, 
but none became aware of me, in turn.
Goblins lived everywhere, but a special danger of the mountains
were the trolls inhabiting caves between the rocks.
Staying within the valley drastically lowered the chances of an encounter,
so I felt fairly safe from their kind.

The journey eventually took it's toll on my stamina.
I hadn't become tired, but my feet and the muscles in my legs ached.
A stream I encountered served as an adequate location to rest,
flowing by some rocks suitable as seating.
Raptors passed far over my head.
Their territories were likely restricted to the outskirts,
lets they themselves become prey for harpies.
Observing them helped pass the time, while my body recovered.

Progress slowed drastically after night had fallen.
Increasingly rocky ground made it hard to find steady footing in the dark.
Adding to that was my first sighting of a troll.
It barely registered as a blob as I notice it, but I took no chances,
taking a detour that lasted a significant portion of the night.
The beast conducted it's hunt as I did so,
darting around at speeds unreasonable for it's size.

Once daybreak arrived, calm had returned to my journey.
The second day closely followed the pattern of the first,
differing mainly in the scenery I passed.
Rocky slopes were replaced by sheer cliffs,
the hallmark of the shatter mountains,
and at noon it finally came into sight.
The peak, split in two. Between them lay my goal.

The awe inspiring colossus appeared as if a wedge had been driven through it,
creating two sides never to be reunited.
This source of my astonishment drifted in and out of sight throughout the day,
becoming obscured by both clouds and closer portions of the mountains.
Vegetation was replaced by rocks,
and the small streams by a single river running opposite where I was going.
A well traveled path ran along it.
I had steered clear of any paths to the best of my abilities,
but the narrowing valley left less and less room to do so.

Throughout the afternoon I encountered a handful of wagons.
None cared to interact with me.
They, no doubt, had their duties to attend to, ferrying wares between kingdoms.
As the only safe route through the Shatter Mountains,
it was irreplaceable for many a merchant, all of which would have to pass
through the border town I had been aiming towards.
The town itself had little to offer,
housing mainly soldiers who acted as guards,
making the town a deathtrap for me.

Regardless of the danger waiting there, I marched on.
Evening came and went, and something I had been fearing came with it.
Hunger. The essence which had sustained me had finally run dry,
but it wasn't the hunger I feared.
It was the fatigue, which would inevitably follow.
Looking at the mountain's summit, now immeasurably high above,
I resolved myself to not rest, until reaching my goal.
This one chance would be my last, after all. I had to take it.

Only late at night did they appear. Lights in the distance.
The soldiers carrying them did their rounds on top of a barricade
blocking the entire valley.
Soon after the lights, rumbling followed.
Quiet at first, but rapidly swelling in volume.
I continued to follow the river, even as the path left it towards the town.
The lights weren't what I had been searching, the rumbling was.

What had been a river expanded into a grand lake,
while the noise became deafening.
Water droplets rained town on me as I approached the waterfall.
It was invisible in the darkness, but encroached on every other sense.
From the descending masses only a fraction was expelled into the river,
leaving the rest to vanish into the depths.
Anything entering this pool would be swallowed by the raging currents,
never to be seen again.

I stopped. My determination wavered.
There was no deeper plan behind my actions.
I had come here because there was nowhere else for me to go,
but I was unsure of what I could gain.
The lights marking the border seemed increasingly inviting.
Nether option was good.
Would the guards recognize me, or would the torrents rip me apart?

I had no answer, so I decided to eat.
If I were to die, there was no point in wasting the bread I had been gifted.
Tearing pieces off the loaf, I watched the guards fulfil their duty.
I had no grudge with them. Nor the right to interrupt their peace.
So, as my meal came to an end, I had decided.
If I were to die, it would be by my own hands.

I wrapped the few possessions I had in the cloak I carried,
then tightly bound it around my chest.
Then, taking one last deep breath,
I stepped towards the edge of the hidden dungeon's entrance and jumped.

Terrifying forces spun me like a leaf in a storm,
pulling me under in an instant.
I was immediately robbed of any sense of direction,
as I was rushed through the subterranean torrents.
Something hard hit my back,
pushing air out of my lungs, but failing to even slow me down.
Some more turns followed, before the currents around me suddenly slowed down.
It was time for me to act.

Spinning my head in panic, I searched.
No light would reach here even in the day, but I searched nonetheless.
My breath had almost run out, by the time I found it.
Flailing my arms, I propelled myself there. A wall.
The rough rock deflected my arm, and I began feeling around
until my hand reached beyond the wall, into an opening.
Pulling myself inward, the sensation around my arm changed. Air.
With one last jerk I hoisted myself through the opening
in what I now knew to be the ceiling.

Taking heavy breaths I lay on an uneven stone floor,
staring at the only thing I saw.
Staring at my old acquaintance.
