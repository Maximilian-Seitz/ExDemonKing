# Escape

The trees flew by me.
In my single-minded flight I paid little attention to my surroundings.
Occasionally a root would catch my foot,
or I would scrape by a bush,
but none of it mattered to me.
There was only forward.

After a while my lungs were burning. The taste of iron entered my mouth.
Every breath was forced out of my chest with more and more difficulty.
Eventually this wouldn't last. There was a limit to my stamina.

My legs started to feel more and more heavy,
as the muscles tore under the stress.
They, too, would soon give out.
Until they reached that point, however, I would push on.

There had been a town nearby. It was chosen as the location of the battle.
One-sidedly. By burning down the town, the hero was lured in.
A cruel deed, that not only destroyed the hero's home,
but also robbed me of my sole chance for respite.

As I considered this, I passed some thicket, and saw it.
A goblin.
No time remained to stop, or even acknowledge this creature.
Its fowl grimace turned to me. It, too, was surprised,
but not alone, as I soon learned.
With no will to turn back,
I dived straight into the group of hip-high humanoids.
Before they had any chance to arm themselves I dodged between them,
leaving them in a daze.

With this, I regained some sense of direction.
The map of this area was among the many things I had observed closely,
from my mental prison.
Goblins should only live close to a dungeon in the vicinity.

Hope arrived. A dungeon wasn't something I could deal with.
This was exactly why it had to become my target.
I would undoubtedly die in the labyrinthian nest of monsters.
That is, if I tried to take it on.

Nothing of the sort even came to mind.
I wouldn't tackle any of the occupants in combat.
There was something else I was aiming for.

With this new plan, I changed direction, taking a sharp left turn.
The goblins were visible through the underbrush.
Their pursuit had started quicker than I had hoped.
This left me no other choice than to use my second-to-last lifeline.

I pulled out another vial from my belt.
An action which would leave many an alchemist in tears
was forced on me. This time I uncorked the potion properly.
No drop would spill. The substance in my hands could regrow limbs
and even reverse the effects of old age,
yet I would use it as a substitute for a simple stamina potion.

The rejuvenating effect spread throughout my body immediately.
The pain in my lung vanished while my legs felt stronger than they ever had.
Having gained some sense of security, I looked back.
The goblins, who had been gaining on me, were falling behind.
Their small statures simply couldn't keep up.

It was bizarre for goblins to be this calming.
Their habit of eating humans along with their lumpy, greasy green skins
would usually make one uneasy at the best of times.
These, however, weren't the best of times.
At this time, the hoard of goblins at my back functioned as a barrier.
Even if they wouldn't serve as an obstacle,
they would, at the very least, serve to cover my tracks.

Thinking this, I glimpsed what I had hoped to find.
Before me lay a small valley devoid of trees.
Its ground, covered in mud, was inhabited by boars.
Even the smallest among them exceeded my height.

> Shit!

I had expected their size,
but as I spotted the burrow's entrance, I realized my mistake.
The mud. My goal was surrounded by mud.
Once I would enter the dungeon,
I anticipated the beasts would care little for me.
Traversing their home, the pit, on the other hand,
would likely disturb them greatly.
Charging through the wallow would slow me down too much to allow me to escape.

Thus, I stopped. I waited.
At first to think, but then I looked back with a smile.
I had, after all, brought friends. Well, temporary allies.
Frankly, distractions.
Regardless of their stunted stature,
what was gathered before us was their main hunting targets.
The conditions for the hunt may not have been ideal,
but that didn't concern me.
Their rage would surely drive them down the slope.

I hadn't ever imagined growing this fond of the little demons.
These feelings, however, didn't linger for long after they came back into sight.
The herd at the bottom consisted of roughly a dozen individuals,
but the number of my followers was yet unknown to me.
Concerns about our fighting force faded quickly,
as their numbers before my eyes grew.
They would do.

The approaching unit wasn't without its dangers,
as some rocks hitting my chest taught me.
Still, I held out. This wasn't the time to be hasty.
The steep slope behind me would allow for a quick escape,
but my pursuers had to follow me.
This was only possible if they did so,
before grasping the location they were led to.

Just a bit longer.
More rocks hit me. My shoulder was sliced open.
It didn't matter. A bit longer. Just a bit.
I jumped.

The sludge, which was the source of my troubles,
served as a fine way to slow my decent.
I slid down the decline, now entirely coated in a layer of wet earth.
No matter. Any camouflage was welcome.
More trouble came from my limbs having sunk into the ground.
The lighter goblins wouldn't be hindered like this,
whereas the boars would simply power through.
Neither was an option for me, so I worked to extract my feet.

By the time I had managed to free one limb, my presence had long been detected.
It wasn't only my presence though. Goblins came to my aid in droves.
Becoming aware of the bigger trouble they now found themselves in,
I hoped most would change their targets.

With a silent prayer aimed at any god that would listen,
I started crawling through this battlefield of my making.
Standing, or even running, was no option for me.
On all fours I encroached on the hole in the ground.
Some goblins trampled over me. Towards the boars.
They knew full well how dangerous this situation was for them,
but their greed and their instincts wouldn't let them flee.
Not that fleeing was a realistic options to begin with.

My progress was largely unimpeded, allowing me to leave the combatants behind.
Once I reached the half way point, I was no longer surrounded.
Leaving the scuffle was necessary, but also left me exposed.
Carefully observing my surroundings, I noticed it.
I had been spotted.

Not by a goblin. A beast furrowed its snout. Its head turned in my direction.
Did it smell me? It didn't matter.

My crawl became more upright. Less concealed, but faster, I had hoped.
It wasn't enough.
A few steps were all I managed to advance by,
until the charging mass collided with me.

I flew. Then hit the hard ground. Hard ground.
With the return of my senses, I knew quickly what this meant.
I had reached the dungeon's entrance.
The boar stood not far from me, ready for another charge.
Blood dripped from its tusk, running into its mouth.

This chance couldn't be wasted. No time remained to even turn around.
I pushed my body back. Scraping along the ground, I hurried,
and just before the boar's trample reached me, something came into sight.
Walls. A ceiling.

It was all made of rough stone, maybe simply solidified dirt,
but for me, it meant safety. The death, which approached me, slowed down.
Interest was lost, as if I had never existed to begin with.
Such was the effect of a dungeon.

Contrary to its appearance, no barrier blocked the way.
The environment within these walls was flooded with mana.
That's what dungeons were.
Most creatures would be able to enter, even that boar.
They merely chose not to. It was comparable to a dive into a swamp.
Who would dive into a swamp to hunt a rabbit, if a pack of wolves attacked.
The wolves weren't ideal, but needed to be dealt with eventually anyway.

So there I sat. Back against the rough rock,
legs across the entrance of my savior cave.
Heavy breaths echoed through the depths.
Outside, chaos reigned.
I just sat there, recovering my stamina.

It felt calm. Oddly so. This was my first moment to enjoy freedom.
It would soon pass, I knew that. There was much left to do,
but I took this moment to look down on myself.
I looked at my hands laying in my lap,
raised them, and slowly started to move my fingers.
They started to tremble.

> I'm… free…

The breathing grew more agitated. The shaking in my hands accelerated.
Pain.

The moment hadn't lasted long, but it was enough to collect myself somewhat.
Since the excitement had faded, the pain rushed in.
Looking over my body, it was hard to make out where a new wound had appeared.
The mud, mixed with blood and torn cloth, revealed little of my actual body.
Taking another breath, I could tell.
The pain originated from my side, slightly below my ribs.

The tusk. This was where I had been pierced and thrown moments earlier.
One last elixir remained.
I didn't intend to waste it, so I wiped the wound clean.
Without fresh water there wasn't much I could do,
but I ripped a strip off my torn shirt, and bound it around my body.
This way I would at least not bleed out as quickly.
The potion was likely required, but I would save it for as long as possible.
I was entering a dungeon. My chances of unharmed passage were low.
The recovery could wait until I was fully safe.

Stiff movements brought me to my feet.
Swaying slightly, I press onto my wound, turning towards the darkness.
Another obstacle I hadn't taken into account.
With me was neither bag nor weapon.
The plan was, after all, for me to die.

The only things on me was what I wore.
The signature equipment.
In my belt was space for three vials.
Now there was one missing, one empty, and one full.
On my back was a cloak.
It was purely decorative, providing neither warmth nor protection.
The once red shoulder-pads had been colored brown and the black velvet torn.
If not for the lack of clothes otherwise, I would have discarded it.
Other than the cloak, there wasn't much covering my upper body anymore.
The enchanted shirt, which normally made armor redundant, barely remained.
No magic remained in the cloth.
In the end, it barely obstructed the holy sword.

The last clothes were my boots and legwear.
Dirt covered them completely, but their function was unchanged.
While comfort was the priority for both,
they too were amazing products.
Being made from hydra leather, they would harden on impact,
but remain smooth in normal use.
Crafting something like this not out of need, but purely for luxury,
hinted at the incomprehensible mind behind the creation.

The problem remained. I had no light. It was funny, really.
Enough material remained on my body to sell to a king,
still, I would have given it all up for a torch.
The solution was obvious to anyone who would dare to enter a place such as this.
Magic.

Everyone knew the tales of adventurers grouping into parties,
where one member always knew this basic spell.

> Light.

Nothing happened. I wasn't familiar with that most basic of spells.
I hadn't cast a spell in my life, but I knew what it felt like.
The feeling of mana going through my body was as familiar to me as breathing.
Invoking this movement, on the other hand, was not.
In a sense, it was more like a heartbeat.
I had observed it constantly, but now I had to make that heart beat on my own.

Between a battlefield and the darkness I stood, closing my eyes.
I had to grasp it somehow, searching for a way to stimulate it this flow.
I felt silly. Nothing worked.
No. Something moved.
At first I didn't notice, and by the time I did,
it had become unclear what had triggered it.
Still, something moved.
It had gone unnoticed due to its magnitude.
The familiar flood had been reduced to no more than a trickle.

> It'll have to do.

No time remained to train to perfection. I had to use what I had.
So I did.
Like trying to catch water droplets with bare hands, I collected the mana.
My hands weren't the destination of the relocation. My eyes were.
The light spell, while universally known, wasn't within my experience.
Not once had I seen this spell be cast, so I wasn't confident in reproducing it.
Instead, I pooled the mana in my eyes.

I formed the little mana there was, hoping it would achieve its purpose.
Shaping it into the image in my mind like clay,
I was able to form a somewhat stable spell.
Soul sight.
Aptly named, it allowed souls to be made out.
It did, of course, work through solid objects to some extent.
Without this feature, the spell would be limited to showing ghosts.
Body-less souls.
Lacking any immediate response, I turned around.

> Ah…

It had worked. Spectral goblins filled my vision.
Many had died. The ghosts would soon disperse, seeking vessels to be reborn in.
Visible souls weren't limited to ghosts.
Members of the clashing groups shone with faint auras.
Satisfied with my findings, I turned around.
Darkness welcomed me. The spell, on its own, wouldn't solve this,
but the protection it provided was invaluable.

I stumbled ahead. One arm extended, the other compressing my bleeding.
Footsteps echoed. The eerie silence was likely caused by the chaotic mana.
Hostile creatures would become apparent before approaching,
but these weren't the only dangers hidden within a dungeon.
The dungeon itself was dangerous.

Mana at high concentrations without any guidance was what defined a dungeon.
Natural phenomena, natural spells, would form on occasion.
Feared for their curses, and celebrated for their blessings,
these spells were famous among adventurers.
Just such an accumulation of energy was what I had come here for.
One of the most infamous.

Many a party had fallen victim to it, or monsters utilizing it.
Due to this infamy occurrences were tracked, whenever found.
Lack of guidance for the mana didn't mean it acted entirely without a pattern.
Like a river following the same path every day,
magical patterns constructed their own circuits.

While I pondered over these things, I tread carefully through the darkness.
A wall. It seemed I had reached an intersection.
Between the path leading in either direction, I chose the one leading left.
Scratches appeared on my hand, as I slid it along the wall.
No other sensations remained.
Blinded, on the quiet descent, I focused.
Waiting for the faintest signs of life.

As time passed, hesitation faded from my steps.
The conflict I had caused had likely ended by now.
Losers devoured by the winners, according to the rules of nature.
Avoiding such a fate was my entire drive when It came.
The first soul in my way.
Shapeless and unmoving it had gathered at the ceiling.

Though shapeless, it was no ghost.
Beings consisting of viscous poison and acid dwelled in dungeons.
Held together purely by the flow of mana,
these stalkers could barely be considered sentient.
Any small fluctuation in their mana was capable of disintegrating them.
I wasn't capable of that. My miniscule amount of mana was focused on my eyes.
I had to find another way.

Approaching the tunnel section beneath my enemy, I detected not a twitch.
Weather it was inattentive or patient, I couldn't tell.
Since I was neither willing to step into its trap,
nor able to initiate out fight, I needed to lure it somehow.
Chances of survival were slim, should it drop on my head.

I ducked and rushed ahead. It could only fall so fast.
A splash. Behind me. Relieved, I spun around and kicked.
Another splash. The soul dispersed.
Unprotected as my torso was,
my boots were laughably over-developed for this environment.
Dripping with residue, these boots would have left a trail of rot around nature.
Sighing in relief I was about to resume my travel, when I stopped.
I uncorked the empty vial, and collected some remains at my feet.

> Shouldn't let good materials go to waste.

Satisfied with myself, I continued onward.
Toughing the wall, to find my bearings, I felt some numbness in my arm.
Contrary to my initial belief, it seemed some poison had reached me.
I sighed. Numbness was preferable to a burn.
Worrying about poison was only going to fasten its spread.

My feet began to feel more steady.
It was unconnected to the poison. It was the ground.
The constant decline had evened out.
I couldn't fathom the structure of this labyrinth so far.
The lack of vision deprived me of a sense of scale for what I had traversed.
For all I knew the tunnel had widened into a room,
or the wall I had followed had been spiraling down.
Some answers could only come with the presence of another soul.

It didn't take long.
This life took the shape of
what could only be described as a puddle on the ground.
A deadly trap for most was rendered impotent by my garments.
Just like a puddle of rain water, it scattered as I leapt into it.
Without a form to circulate its mana in, it died, leaving me blind once more.
My assumption seemed to have been somewhat correct.
The gap between the wall and where I had arrived measured two arm spans.

I went on.
Like the two before, I encountered two more slimes,
one of which I was able to avoid.
Occasional sharp turns would now appear on the wall that guided me.
Different conditions would attract different species.
With the threat I passed earlier still in sight,
covered by some walls, another form appeared.
Much more defined than the arbitrarily contorting.
A rat.

Fattened up by its energetic surroundings, it grew up to my knee.
This ferocious foe wasn't one I would approach lightly.
Jumping, biting, slashing.
Once a junk of flesh was ripped from its victim, most would fail to respond.
I was no different. I had to prepare beforehand.
Standing still, I observed its movements.

No pattern became clear to me. It was still a rat.
It moved carelessly and with no discernible objective.
Eventually it made its way in my direction.
I felt unprotected.
Remembering the last corner, I retreated a few steps.
This might afford me the element of surprise.
My plan was already formed.
Few options lead to a quick decision.

I pulled the dangerous residue from my belt, holding the opened vial in my hand.
The rat approached. I hoped my boots were still covered.
It turned the corner.
I swung the bottle, scattering its contents.
My foot flew. A squeal echoed. The rat, it fled.

Having clearly scared the predator, I couldn't let this advantage go to waste.
Sprinting off, it would clearly lead me into a trap.
I followed.
No wall was needed to guide me. The native knew its path.
Where would it take me, I wondered. In the end, one safeguard remained.
Should it run to its home, I could see its comrades before they saw me.
So I faithfully followed.

The chase continued around a some corners.
To me, it felt random.
As it went on, my condition worsened.
My wounds flared up. Feeling in my arm almost completely disappeared.
I had been running on fumes for too long already,
but I decided to keep up.

As if sharing my pain, my prey suddenly slowed down.
Putting little trust in its empathy, I looked out for its trick.
I kept going. Our distance shrank. I had almost reached it,
when it jumped.
It jumped to the left. I went straight.
A flash.

I closed my eyes. Overwhelmed by the sudden light, not even my spell would work.
Yet, the darkness did not return.
I didn't open my eyes, but started seeing many specks, but no rat.
The rat had disappeared. Or rather, I had fallen for its trap.
I had disappeared.

I opened my eyes. Around me, there were trees.
It had worked. I was gone.
Every tension in my body dropped. I collapsed to my knees.

There was one last thing to do. I took the last vial.
Savoring every last drop, I celebrated the success of my escape.
