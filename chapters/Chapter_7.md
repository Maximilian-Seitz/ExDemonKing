# Debt

I opened my eyes. Cold stone walls were lit by stones shedding dim light.
With hazy thoughts, I barely managed to comprehend myself being within the city,
before my consciousness slipped away again.

My surroundings hadn't changed by the time I awakened again,
but the fog clouding my thoughts had weakened.
Along with the clear thoughts came pain. 
My right arm, my stomach, they hurt, along with places all over my body,
especially my back.
Despite the stone building, whatever it was I lay on was soft.

My bed was placed in the center of this room,
leaving enough space on every side for a person to pass with outstretched hands,
as though it served as a table with people seated on all sides.
Turning my head away from the ceiling,
I noticed the lack of furniture in this dwelling,
along with a lack of decorations of any sort.
Trying to prop myself up only resulted in an assault of agony.
I turned the other way instead, where I found a door made of wood. Closed.

To my surprised, I was still alive, but unable to properly move.
Hungry, thirsty and in pain, I decided to assess my situation as best I could.
My options in any case were limited,
but I wanted to do everything within my means.
Raising my torso was impossible, as I had already found out,
due to the pain from my abdomen.
I tried moving my legs instead.
Careful not to use my chest as leverage,
I slowly raised one foot after the other. They responded.

Next was my arms.
The right arm, which had taken most of the damage,
had clearly barely started to heal, as evidenced by how it felt.
My left hand came into view without problems, except for what was missing.
It was unreasonable to expect myself to still hold it, but the feather was gone.
The other hand, however, failed to show itself at all.
Rather than the hand, bandages appeared. Wrapped around a stump.

Roughly at the center of my forearm, the appendage simply ended.
Though not surprising, the sight was surreal.
I had thought myself to have long felt disconnected from my body at this point,
apathetic towards any damage it sustained,
even now that I lacked the means to heal it.
Still, I felt loss.
Loss at a tool, but more so loss at something I had just recently regained,
and with it, anger at its having been taken from me,
for so long, in the first place.

I settled down, observing the crimson hue make its way
from the inner layers of the dressing to the outside.
Nothing was left for me to do but wait for my wounds to close.
Such was the nature of injuries, after all.
My surroundings, conversely, had no such limitations,
as evidenced by the many people passing the hall next to the door.
Through the thick walls, only so much insight was to be gained,
but I did notice how nonthreatening the passing individuals were.

It was hard to tell weather those passing were the same ones repeatedly,
owing to the weak presences they emanated,
until someone came, who was clearly different.
The newcomer didn't pass, but stepped towards my door to open it.
Their strength was apparent, even through their dull aura.
An aura so dull, that this, in and of itself, was of note,
simply presenting as an intricate duplicate of a person's physical traits.

All auras mirrored the physical bodies which they governed to some degree,
but in others it guided the formation of a sort of caricature,
like Roy, covered in blood, or the divinity of the sphynx.
Weaker souls still followed the same principle,
though less refined and exaggerated,
and even demons were somewhat influenced by the bodies they manifested in.
Still, none I had seen came even close
to the detailed image now shining through the door.

The man, clearly native to this city,
was dressed in nothing but a long grey robe, bound around the waist with twine.
For all the intricacies of his appearance, this was his only accessory.
It was the dress of the faithful, at least where I had grown up,
so I felt it reasonable to assume him to be pious, presenting like this.
No hair grew on his brown head,
but his face was handsome and underlined by a square jaw.

As the door opened, the only difference
in the overlapping images I saw was a leather bag he carried in his hand,
formed like a small chest, held closed by two leather straps with buckles.
His gaze fell on my hand, held above my head,
lingered there for a short moment, then met mine.
He reacted with a bright, but calming, smile.

> How good to see you awake.

> Have you been taking care of me?

> Yes, with help from others from the temple.
> I have come to change your bandages, but didn't think you were awake.

> Then I thank you, and the other faithful as well. I'm in your debt.

> No. You are a citizen of Hest, after all.

> Auli will explain… It was her idea.

He sounded uncomfortable with the information he volunteered,
so I chose to hold back with my inquiry.
There was something else on my mind instead.

> Have my belongings been brought with me?

> Most of them were destroyed. I keep all others…

Saying so, he placed the bag he had brought on the floor,
undid its buckles with dexterous movements,
and produced a wooden box large enough to hold a dagger.

> …including this.

Holding the box at an angle, so that I would see the contents,
he carefully lifted its lid. Inside was a feather. My feather.

> You still held it tight while asleep. Is it important to you?

Was he planning to hold it captive? Was this why he had said I had no debt?
I doubted he could even know its function.
While questions raced through my mind, there was nothing I could do,
and what had appeared as a kind smile, until just then, now seemed wicked.

> Oh, don't worry. I don't plan to take it from you.

> But I want to ask where you found it.

> A old man… a farmer, he gave it to me. I saved his life from a goblin attack.
> He claimed the hero gave it to him, as protection.

Feigning a connection between the artifact and the hero seemed reasonable,
as a way to obfuscate the feather's connection to Fate, along with my own.
Without knowing the extent of his insight,
I tried to minimize the additional information I provided.

> Is that so? Then you should make sure not to lose it.
> Divine artifacts are precious, and dangerous in the wrong hands.

After closing the box, with as much care as he used to opened it,
he approached my bed and placed it near my shoulder.
Only then did the man return to fetch the bag he had left behind.

> Now hold out your arm. I will rebandage the wound.

I followed the instruction obediently,
and had the wrappings removed from my stump.
Below it, where I expected to see my flesh, a dark green substance was revealed.
Some structures resembling small leaves were visible,
even through the gelatinous mass of dark blood covering it.
Though grotesque, none of it was removed, only a layer of fresh herbs added,
provided by the leather bag.
To cover them, a stripe of cloth then bound the wound.

> Keeping it up, as you did, helps, but try not to move it too much.
> The same is true for your whole body, really.
> Herbs have their limits, and these mainly dull the pain.

> I'll be mindful of it.

> I will go send for food and drink now. You have lost too much blood.

> I will also tell Auli about your awakening. I'm sure she'll be here first…

Letting out an exhausted sigh with the last sentence,
my physician retrieved the surplus herbs and bandages,
then left through the only door in the room.
That same door didn't remain closed for long however,
flying open with enough force to put its structure at risk.
An overwhelming aura had appeared,
but had left me with no chance to process any information about it
before my intruder made their startling entrance.

> Ah, you're up!

The soul and voice were ones I recognized.
A female fighter alongside whom I had journeyed into the jungle,
and the one I had heard moments before passing out.
Along with her, she carried an inferno.
Not hot, but still overpowering my senses.
The chestnut colored hair flowing to her upper back
was covered in a veil of flame as wild as her entry,
and her face in a wide toothy grin.
Unbothered by my lack of response, or the noise of the creaking door,
she approached with pride.

> It's about time! Sutarbi said you'd die, but I told him not to let you.

I shared nether her enthusiasm about the situation,
nor her faith in this threat's effectiveness, but kept it to myself.

> Greetings. I, too, am surprised by my survival.
> I believe you, among others, are to thank for it?

> Well, I just though it'd be best to get you
> outa that damn forest, and into the city.
> Priests took care of rest, really.

> Only hassle was how to get them to help you,
> but nothing worth loosing a good scout over!
> And it looks like it was worth it.
> I'm sure you'll be out and about, helping us out, in no time.

She punctuated her optimistic claim with a slap on my shoulder,
clearly not paying any mind to adjusting her strength to my condition.

> So, when do you think we can count on you?

> Count on me?

> Yea! You'll still scout, right?
> So we're gonna be colleagues now, with you being a citizen and all.
> It's not like there's much else you can do with that missing hand anyway,
> and we really needed a brave scout.

> Oh, and don't worry, we're not gonna throw you in cold.
> You just started out, right? We'll show you the ropes.
> You're already pretty good, so I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time,
> and help us out.

There it was again, a mention of my status as a citizen,
but I had failed to interject to ask about it in time,
and now I was at a loss for how to bring it up.
She had moved on with her conversation.

> We're gonna go a bit farther from the city,
> but you're gonna have us with you, so you're gonna be safer there
> than you're gonna be with a bunch of untrained thugs on patrol.
> Oh, and you're not gonna have to work for scraps either!
> We'll get you some clothes, and some food, and there's a place you can stay.
> Can't get all that just going on patrol.
> Sounds good, right?

She had lost me. I wasn't sure what to answer.
I wasn't even sure if this was a proposal, or a command of some sort.
Taking the time to order my thoughts only resulted in me
inadvertently yielding my chance to respond.

> Oh, and you're not gonna have to work with Roy anymore.
> That bastard would 'a left you for dead.
> And the food's great.
> There's cooks here that really know what they're doing.
> Nothing like that junk adventurers eat.
> And when you're free, you can learn how to read.
> There's a whole place, just filled with books and scrolls, and stuff.
> No idea who's gonna read them all, but it sure looks impressive.
> They're great teachers. I can even read a bit myself now.

> Wait. Please.

To my surprise, my plea was heard.
She stopped in her tracks, like a startled animal.
Feeling bad for reining in her enthusiastic rambling,
I brought myself to ask my question after a short moment of silence.

> You said I'm a citizen. What do you mean by that?

> Ah…

Rather than regaining her momentum, she paused.
During that pause, I was sure I saw her flames recede slightly.
While I worried about any unintended offence my question may have caused,
I saw her chest swell from a deep breath.

> I'll explain… You see, treatment here isn't available to just anyone.
> You either have to pay a hefty price, or be a citizen.

> So, well, we made you a citizen.
> There were *some* issues, but we figured it out.

> That's…

> Don't thank me yet. I know it sounds good right now,
> but a citizen here is different than anywhere else.
> Actually, most adventurers avoid it.

> See, you're bound to the city.
> They help you out, but you also have to help out.
> You can't go and find some treasure to get rich, or anything.
> When you do anything, it's always for the city.
> It irks people.

> But I don't think it's bad. It's like a family.
> They also help you out when you need it.

A family.

> Huh…

> Isn't it dangerous to take in outsiders into something like that?

> What?

> What if someone who's taken in is dangerous?

> Well, then we're here to help out with that…

What if someone who's taken in has a dangerous enemy? I couldn't ask that.

> Some folk do try to take advantage of us by running off
> after getting a lot of help,
> but that's why it's not that easy to become a citizen.
> But I think you're focusing on the wrong thing here.
> You're not really free to go anywhere you want anymore…
> Are you fine with that?

> There wasn't anywhere in particular I ever intended to go in the first place,
> so I don't mind it at all.
> Rather, it sounds quite advantageous.

> Oh, yea. Yea, it's great!

The girl's spirit returned with the same
lack of consistency it disappeared with, along with the potency of her flame.

> Great, with that we're gonna be companions!
