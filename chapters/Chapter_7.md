# Debt

I opened my eyes. Cold stone walls were lit by stones shedding dim light.
With hazy thoughts, I barely managed to comprehend myself being within the city,
before my consciousness slipped away again.

My surroundings hadn't changed by the time I awakened again,
but the fog clouding my thoughts had lowered.
Along with the clear thoughts came pain. 
My right arm, my stomach, they hurt, along with places all over my body,
especially my back.
Despite the stone building, whatever it was I lay on was soft.
