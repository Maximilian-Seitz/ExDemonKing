# Debt

I opened my eyes. Cold stone walls were lit by stones shedding dim light.
With hazy thoughts, I barely managed to comprehend myself being within the city,
before my consciousness slipped away again.

My surroundings hadn't changed by the time I awakened again,
but the fog clouding my thoughts had weakened.
Along with the clear thoughts came pain. 
My right arm, my stomach, they hurt, along with places all over my body,
especially my back.
Despite the stone building, whatever it was I lay on was soft.

My bed was placed in the center of this room,
leaving enough space on every side for a person to pass with outstretched hands,
as though it served as a table with people seated on all sides.
Turning my head away from the ceiling,
I noticed the lack of furniture in this dwelling,
along with a lack of decorations of any sort.
Trying to prop myself up only resulted in an assault of agony.
I turned the other way instead, where I found a door made of wood. Closed.

To my surprised, I was still alive, but unable to properly move.
Hungry, thirsty and in pain, I decided to assess my situation as best I could.
My options in any case were limited,
but I wanted to do everything within my means.
Raising my torso was impossible, as I had already found out,
due to the pain from my abdomen.
I tried moving my legs instead.
Careful not to use my chest as leverage,
I slowly raised one foot after the other. They responded.

Next was my arms.
The right arm, which had taken most of the damage,
had clearly barely started to heal, as evidenced by how it felt.
My left hand came into view without problems, except for what was missing.
It was unreasonable to expect myself to still hold it, but the feather was gone.
The other hand, however, failed to show itself at all.
Rather than the hand, bandages appeared. Wrapped around a stump.

Roughly at the center of my forearm, the appendage simply ended.
Though not surprising, the sight was surreal.
I had thought myself to have long felt disconnected from my body at this point,
apathetic towards any damage it sustained,
even now that I lacked the means to heal it.
Still, I felt loss.
Loss at a tool, but more so loss at something I had just recently regained,
and with it, anger at it's having been taken from me,
for so long, in the first place.

I settled down, observing the crimson hue make it's way
from the inner layers of the dressing to the outside.
Nothing was left for me to do but wait for my wounds to close.
Such was the nature of injuries, after all.
My surroundings, conversely, had no such limitations,
as evidenced by the many people passing the hall next to the door.
Through the thick walls, only so much insight was to be gained,
but I did notice how nonthreatening the passing individuals were.

It was hard to tell weather those passing were the same ones repeatedly,
owing to the weak presences they emanated,
until someone came, who was clearly different.
The newcomer didn't pass, but stepped towards my door to open it.
Their strength was apparent, even through their dull aura.
An aura so dull, that this, in and of itself, was of note,
simply presenting as an intricate duplicate of a person's physical traits.

All auras mirrored the physical bodies which they governed to some degree,
but in others it guided the formation of a sort of caricature,
like Roy, covered in blood, or the divinity of the sphynx.
Weaker souls still followed the same principle,
though less refined and exaggerated,
and even demons were somewhat influenced by the bodies they manifested in.
Still, none I had seen came even close
to the detailed image now shining through the door.

The man, clearly native to this city,
was dressed in nothing but a long grey robe, bound around the waist with twine.
For all the intricacies of his appearance, this was his only accessory.
It was the dress of the faithful, at least where I had grown up,
so I felt it reasonable to assume him to be pious, presenting like this.
No hair grew on his brown head,
but his face was handsome and underlined by a square jaw.

As the door opened, the only difference
in the overlapping images I saw was a leather bag he carried in his hand,
formed like a small chest, held closed by two leather straps with buckles.
His gaze fell on my hand, held above my head,
lingered there for a short moment, then met mine.
He reacted with a bright, but calming, smile.

> How good to see you awake.
