# Debt

I opened my eyes. Cold stone walls were lit by stones shedding dim light.
With hazy thoughts, I barely managed to comprehend myself being within the city,
before my consciousness slipped away again.

My surroundings hadn't changed by the time I awakened again,
but the fog clouding my thoughts had weakened.
Along with the clear thoughts came pain. 
My right arm, my stomach, they hurt, along with places all over my body,
especially my back.
Despite the stone building, whatever it was I lay on was soft.

My bed was placed in the center of this room,
leaving enough space on every side for a person to pass with outstretched hands,
as though it served as a table with people seated on all sides.
Turning my head away from the ceiling,
I noticed the lack of furniture in this dwelling,
along with a lack of decorations of any sort.
Trying to prop myself up only resulted in an assault of agony.
I turned the other way instead, where I found a door made of wood. Closed.

To my surprised, I was still alive, but unable to properly move.
Hungry, thirsty and in pain, I decided to assess my situation as best I could.
My options in any case were limited,
but I wanted to do everything within my means.
Raising my torso was impossible, as I had already found out,
due to the pain from my abdomen.
I tried moving my legs instead.
Careful not to use my chest as leverage,
I slowly raised one foot after the other. They responded.

Next was my arms.
The right arm, which had taken most of the damage,
had clearly barely started to heal, as evidenced by how it felt.
My left hand came into view without problems, except for what was missing.
It was unreasonable to expect myself to still hold it, but the feather was gone.
The other hand, however, failed to show itself at all.
Rather than the hand, bandages appeared. Wrapped around a stump.

Roughly at the center of my forearm, the appendage simply ended.
Though not surprising, the sight was surreal.
I had thought myself to have long felt disconnected from my body at this point,
apathetic towards any damage it sustained,
even now that I lacked the means to heal it.
Still, I felt loss.
Loss at a tool, but more so loss at something I had just recently regained,
and with it, anger at it's having been taken from me,
for so long, in the first place.
