# Debt

I opened my eyes. Cold stone walls were lit by stones shedding dim light.
With hazy thoughts, I barely managed to comprehend myself being within the city,
before my consciousness slipped away again.

My surroundings hadn't changed by the time I awakened again,
but the fog clouding my thoughts had weakened.
Along with the clear thoughts came pain. 
My right arm, my stomach, they hurt, along with places all over my body,
especially my back.
Despite the stone building, whatever it was I lay on was soft.

My bed was placed in the center of this room,
leaving enough space on every side for a person to pass with outstretched hands,
as though it served as a table with people seated on all sides.
Turning my head away from the ceiling,
I noticed the lack of furniture in this dwelling,
along with a lack of decorations of any sort.
Trying to prop myself up only resulted in an assault of agony.
I turned the other way instead, where I found a door made of wood. Closed.

To my surprised, I was still alive, but unable to properly move.
Hungry, thirsty and in pain, I decided to assess my situation as best I could.
My options in any case were limited,
but I wanted to do everything within my means.
Raising my torso was impossible, as I had already found out,
due to the pain from my abdomen.
I tried moving my legs instead.
Careful not to use my chest as leverage,
I slowly raised one foot after the other. They responded.

Next was my arms.
The right arm, which had taken most of the damage,
had clearly barely started to heal, as evidenced by how it felt.
My left hand came into view without problems, except for what was missing.
It was unreasonable to expect myself to still hold it, but the feather was gone.
The other hand, however, failed to show itself at all.
Rather than the hand, bandages appeared. Wrapped around a stump.

Roughly at the center of my forearm, the appendage simply ended.
Though not surprising, the sight was surreal.
I had thought myself to have long felt disconnected from my body at this point,
apathetic towards any damage it sustained,
even now that I lacked the means to heal it.
Still, I felt loss.
Loss at a tool, but more so loss at something I had just recently regained,
and with it, anger at its having been taken from me,
for so long, in the first place.

I settled down, observing the crimson hue make its way
from the inner layers of the dressing to the outside.
Nothing was left for me to do but wait for my wounds to close.
Such was the nature of injuries, after all.
My surroundings, conversely, had no such limitations,
as evidenced by the many people passing the hall next to the door.
Through the thick walls, only so much insight was to be gained,
but I did notice how nonthreatening the passing individuals were.

It was hard to tell weather those passing were the same ones repeatedly,
owing to the weak presences they emanated,
until someone came, who was clearly different.
The newcomer didn't pass, but stepped towards my door to open it.
Their strength was apparent, even through their dull aura.
An aura so dull, that this, in and of itself, was of note,
simply presenting as an intricate duplicate of a person's physical traits.

All auras mirrored the physical bodies which they governed to some degree,
but in others it guided the formation of a sort of caricature,
like Roy, covered in blood, or the divinity of the sphynx.
Weaker souls still followed the same principle,
though less refined and exaggerated,
and even demons were somewhat influenced by the bodies they manifested in.
Still, none I had seen came even close
to the detailed image now shining through the door.

The man, clearly native to this city,
was dressed in nothing but a long grey robe, bound around the waist with twine.
For all the intricacies of his appearance, this was his only accessory.
It was the dress of the faithful, at least where I had grown up,
so I felt it reasonable to assume him to be pious, presenting like this.
No hair grew on his brown head,
but his face was handsome and underlined by a square jaw.

As the door opened, the only difference
in the overlapping images I saw was a leather bag he carried in his hand,
formed like a small chest, held closed by two leather straps with buckles.
His gaze fell on my hand, held above my head,
lingered there for a short moment, then met mine.
He reacted with a bright, but calming, smile.

> How good to see you awake.

> Have you been taking care of me?

> Yes, with help from others from the temple.
> I have come to change your bandages, but didn't think you were awake.

> Then I thank you, and the other faithful as well. I'm in your debt.

> No. You are a citizen of this city, after all.

> Sarah will explain… It was her idea.

He sounded uncomfortable with the information he volunteered,
so I chose to hold back with my inquiry.
There was something else on my mind instead.

> Have my belongings been brought with me?

> Most of them were destroyed. I keep all others…

Saying so, he placed the bag he had brought on the floor,
undid its buckles with dexterous movements,
and produced a wooden box large enough to hold a dagger.

> …including this.

Holding the box at an angle, so that I would see the contents,
he carefully lifted its lid. Inside was a feather. My feather.

> You still held it tight while asleep. Is it important to you?

Was he planning to hold it captive? Was this why he had said I had no debt?
I doubted he could even know its function.
While questions raced through my mind, there was nothing I could do,
and what had appeared as a kind smile, until just then, now seemed wicked.

> Oh, don't worry. I don't plan to take it from you.

> But I want to ask where you found it.

> A old man… a farmer, he gave it to me. I saved his life from a goblin attack.
> He claimed the hero gave it to him, as protection.

Feigning a connection between the artifact and the hero seemed reasonable,
as a way to obfuscate the feather's connection to Fate, along with my own.
Without knowing the extent of his insight,
I tried to minimize the additional information I provided.

> Is that so? Then you should make sure not to lose it.
> Divine artifacts are precious, and dangerous in the wrong hands.

After closing the box, with as much care as he used to opened it,
he approached my bed and placed it near my shoulder.
Only then did the man return to fetch the bag he had left behind.

> Now hold out your arm. I will rebandage the wound.

I followed the instruction obediently,
and had the wrappings removed from my stump.
Below it, where I expected to see my flesh, a dark green substance was revealed.
Some structures resembling small leaves were visible,
even through the gelatinous mass of dark blood covering it.
Though grotesque, none of it was removed, only a layer of fresh herbs added,
provided by the leather bag.
To cover them, a stripe of cloth then bound the wound.
